## Work experience

### 2024.04 - Present, Avant Arte, Senior Software Engineer

As part of a small engineering team, I led end-to-end feature development for an artist-collector collaboration platform, taking full ownership from initial scoping and technical requirements through implementation and testing. Working with modern JavaScript frontend stack and Go backend, I delivered high-impact features that enhanced user experience. The role demanded cross-functional collaboration to deliver detail-oriented solutions that meet art industry standards while maintaining optimal user experience, performance, and accessibility compliance.

### 2022.09 - 2023.11, Polygon, Senior Software Engineer

As a member of the Polygon Nightfall team, I was responsible for building and maintaining frontend applications written in Next.js and React Native. I created and extended several backend APIs written in Node.js. I spent much time at Polygon on backend performance audits and designing more resource-efficient solutions. Moreover, I played a role in transitioning our core API to Rust, marking my first professional contribution using this programming language. I have been involved in recruiting engineers at all levels.

### 2021.12 - 2022.08, Semble (formerly Heydoc), Software Engineer

I was responsible for the ongoing development of the platform. I collaborated with UI/UX designers to translate design mockups into functional, visually appealing, thoroughly tested React components. Alongside this, I also designed and developed backend solutions and data models for new features, mainly using Node.js and several No-SQL database solutions. I actively participated in the architectural changes to the platform.

### 2021.01 - 2021.11, Mindera, Lead Software Engineer

After a few years at Mindera, I was promoted to lead-level developer of an international fashion brand. I continued doing what I love — writing code but was also responsible for leading a team of talented backend engineers. In addition, I participated in designing high-level infrastructures of AWS micro-services and was a core member of the platform for the whole organisation.

### 2018.06 - 2020.12, Mindera, Software Engineer

I was involved in several significantly sized projects. Being a core part of the frontend team for a reputable e-commerce brand, I used technologies like React and Redux to build a top-performance, accessible web app. After transitioning from frontend to backend, I worked extensively with a server-less stack built on the AWS platform. I supported a team of talented developers in staying on top of the fast-paced industry by writing articles, organising workshops, and openly sharing knowledge with others. I was also actively involved in the company's recruitment process and helped organise conferences and local meet-ups.

### 2016.06 - 2018.05, Engine Creative, Front-end Developer

I was responsible for developing a wide variety of projects for clients from a diverse range of industries. The projects range from brand websites built on WordPress to small- to medium-sized web apps using React, React Native, and Vue. Further to this, I have also supported the development of VR and AR apps using A-Frame, Wikitude and Unity. In addition, I contribute to weekly catchups with my colleagues and enjoy helping them expand their knowledge and passion for web technologies. Within my first year at Engine Creative, my colleagues voted me one of the best employees at the company.

### 2014.07 - 2016.05, Creare, Front-end Developer

I was responsible for the front-end side of the web projects. Tasks included: picking a technology that suits the client's requirements (mainly small/medium size WordPress projects), integration with optional frameworks, complex cross-device and cross-platform testing and deployment to the live server. In addition, I was involved in a series of weekly presentations about the latest front-end techniques and long-term training mainly focused on JavaScript. After my first year, I was chosen out of the hundreds of talented employees and awarded “Innovator Of The Year 2015”.

### 2014.03 - 2014.06, Freetimers Internet, Front-end Developer

I was responsible for various tasks such as creating websites from scratch, implementing new modules to existing projects, modernising the design or functionality of old websites, and implementing static websites into CMS (custom CMS made by Freetimers Internet). Moreover, as a part of the company's front-end team, I would utilise the latest techniques and standards to make my work more relevant in a changeable industry.

### 2012.09 - 2014.02, dobrzedobrze.net, Front-end Developer / Co-owner

I was responsible for building web projects for my clients, from designing the UI using Adobe Creative Suite applications (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and Fireworks) to choosing the best strategy and tools for development using the latest techniques like HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. I have built most projects using a CMS system (WordPress). I converted dated websites into user-friendly ones using various contemporary techniques (CSS Media Queries and jQuery).

### 2009.12 - 2011.12, TM Druk (print house and DTP studio), Graphic Designer / DTP

I was responsible for offering various print design services, from brochures to brand design. I also had to maintain the printing facilities, which I needed to learn how to do first. However, as a total novice, I mastered my colour management and DTP skills.
