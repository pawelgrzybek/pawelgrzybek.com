I have been part of a development team at [Semble](https://www.semble.io) (formerly Heydoc) for over eight months, and it‚Äôs been a blast. Working there comes with a great list of benefits, but my favourite perk is two extra ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù days.

> These are 2 extra days of paid time off per year to focus on yourself. Whether you use them for self-care, wellbeing activities, learning something new or towards your personal development is totally up to you!

I recently got into a new hobby that helps me balance time in front of a screen and time to relax ‚Äî woodworking. It looks like I am not an exception because all cool mid-thirty, nerdy geeks are doing it nowadays.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">as i get older i find that there is nothing a man with a decade working in tech wants more than to get deeply into woodworking<br><br>no more software only little wooden stools and side tables</p>&mdash; jackie luo (@jackiehluo) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackiehluo/status/1555279570806390784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

So, instead of booking my ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù days to do the regular crap we all do every day, I decided to do something that makes me feel good ‚Äî ‚Äúwooden stools and side tables‚Äù. I just wanted to share a few pictures of the recently-built things (sanding is boring, but my girlfriend is always happy to help).

Maybe this quick post will inspire you to step away from your keyboard for a moment and learn a skill not related to constantly staring at the computer.

Stay safe, my friend ü™ö
