## The Book of Shaders

[https://thebookofshaders.com/](https://thebookofshaders.com/)

Are you into a computer graphics? Are you into a math as well? If yes — this is a resource for you. I learned a lot from this book and I can't believe that this amazing resource is available totally for free. Thanks to talented and super clever [Patricio Gonzalez Vivo](https://twitter.com/patriciogv) and [Jen Lowe](http://jenlowe.net/).

> This book is about the revolutionary computational technique, fragment shaders, that is taking digitally generated images to the next level. You can think of it as the equivalent of Gutenberg's press for graphics. Fragment shaders give you total control over the pixels rendered on the screen at a super fast speed. This is why they're used in all sort of cases, from video filters on cellphones to incredible 3D video games.

A collaborative working in a real time is something that lots of digital tools implemented recently. Figma, Google Docs, iWork apps and many more. Today Microsoft is joining the bandwagon and announces Live Sharing. The demo video on the website is looking fantastic.

[Mathias Bynens](https://twitter.com/mathias) from V8 team explains a syntax of dynamic `import()` in JavaScript and provides a great practical example. Clear comparison between static `import` helped me a lot to grasp the new concept.

## CSS element() function

[https://iamvdo.me/en/blog/css-element-function](https://iamvdo.me/en/blog/css-element-function)

This article literally blown my mind! CSS element can draw an image based on a reference to `id` of a HTML element. Again! Image from HTML element! Played around with it a little while and I'm shocked! Firefox only — gutted!

## Take control of your scroll: customizing pull-to-refresh and overflow effects

[https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/11/overscroll-behavior](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/11/overscroll-behavior)

You know this situation when you have a multiple scrollable elements on a page — lets say a main content and chat-box in the corner of your Facebook window. How many times you left a cursor of a conversation window because you overscrolled it? CSS comes with some solution — `overscroll-behavior`. Never again JavaScript hacks on a fixed navigations.

[Dennis Gaebel](https://twitter.com/DroidPinkman) published a great intro to the magic of CSS Math Functions Level 4. It allows us to clamp values in very intuitive way — no more messy CSS locks. Can't wait to see this implementation across the browsers.
