Elon Musk, a visionary genius, billionaire, engineer, physicist, father, founder of the most successful companies in the automotive, energy, finance and space industry. What’s not fascinating about him? Because I love biographies, I recently read ["Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future" by Ashlee Vance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25541028-elon-musk) , and I think it is a book worthy of your time.

It is an inspiring tale that tells the story of Elon from early childhood in South Africa up to his recent successes in the space industry. A story based on series of interviews with Musks relatives and close friends. Elon Musk is brilliant, driven by a bigger vision, ridiculously confident, sometimes stubborn regular guy. It is a motivational read for all entrepreneurs hungry for new challenges and for all tech-savvy people keen to learn more about visions from the future.

As much as I liked this book, I am looking forward to Elon’s biography written by Walter Isaacson. After all, his interpretation of Steve's Job's story was the best biography book that I have read so far. I am sure the one about Elon will be a page-turner. Yes, it is in the making now 😉
