There's a lot thats changed in my life in the last 3.5 years. From the frontend, through the backend, I became a Lead Software Engineer of a team of developers way smarter than me. During this time, I also had an opportunity to co-organize and host one of the biggest conferences in the Web industry. I was a guest in a podcast! I met people who became my best friends! I drank a lot of beers with them too. It all was possible just because I joined [Mindera](https://mindera.com) in June 2018. I consider this one of the best decisions I have ever made.

From the bottom of my heart, thank you!

This chapter is over now. I am glad to announce that in December 2021, I am joining a small team of talented programmers at [Heydoc](https://www.heydoc.co.uk) as a Senior Software Engineer. I will be working on a next-generation tool to revolutionize the healthcare industry, helping doctors with their day-to-day tasks and, most importantly, patients stay healthy.
