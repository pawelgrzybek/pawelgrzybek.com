## [Netlify Acquires Gatsby Inc. to Accelerate Adoption of Composable Web Architectures](https://www.netlify.com/press/netlify-acquires-gatsby-inc-to-accelerate-adoption-of-composable-web-architectures/)

One of the best frameworks from the JAMStack family was acquired by Netlify — my favourite hosting company. So even tho Gatsby is not something I have been using a lot, I believe it nicely fits into Netlify's mantra. 

## [Pushing Interop Forward in 2023](https://webkit.org/blog/13706/interop-2023/)

Top Web giants came together to improve the interoperability of the Web platform as a whole. Apple, Bocoup, Google, Igalia, Microsoft, and Mozilla are working together on web standards which resulted in significant improvements last year. This year is going to be similar, and looking at the main areas of focus, the future of the Web seems promising. Color spaces and functions, container queries, font feature detection and palettes, inert, modules, to name a few, which I am excited about. [The web-platform-tests dashboard](https://wpt.fyi/interop-2023) is a handy up-to-date resource where we can track the progress of each vendor.

## [The Third Browser War](https://mobiledevmemo.com/the-new-browser-wars/)

When writing this article, it is against [Apple’s developer guidelines](https://mobiledevmemo.com/the-new-browser-wars/) to use Web context driven by an engine other than Apple’s WebKit. This didn’t scare other Web giants to work in the background on browsers based on Google’s Chromium and Firefoxe’s Geco. Is it just playing ahead of the game, assuming that Apple will change their policy? Maybe they know more than we do about some upcoming changes? I don’t know, but I am sure opening iOS for new engines is going to big a significant event in this industry. Subject worth following.

## [React.js: The Documentary](https://youtu.be/8pDqJVdNa44)

Honeypot is well known for its high-quality video productions about open-source project development. They released a big one about React.js, which is outstandingly good. I enjoyed every single second of this production. From the early days and the very sceptically received presentation, through the polishing process, to the trophy of the most popular framework nowadays.

## [High Definition CSS Color Guide](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/high-definition-css-color-guide/)

This resource by [Adam Argyle](https://nerdy.dev) is a gem. Lengthy but absolutely worth reading. It is the resource you should read if you are confused about the recent hype about new color notations, spaces and gamuts introduced by the [CSS Color Module Level 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/).

## [Use Maps More and Objects Less](https://www.builder.io/blog/maps)

This an excellent reminder from [Steve Sewell from builder.io](https://twitter.com/steve8708) about the potential of Maps and Sets in JavaScript and why we should use them more often instead of Sets and Maps. When are they better than objects, and what are their little-known benefits? Very good read.
