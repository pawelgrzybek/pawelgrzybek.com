## [Why the GOV.UK Design System team changed the input type for numbers](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2020/02/24/why-the-gov-uk-design-system-team-changed-the-input-type-for-numbers/)

A few consideration behind the number type input. This article provides a solutions for well articulated problems. I love accessibility reads like this, especially from Gov UK team.

## [MonoLisa - A font family designed for software developers. Font follows function](https://monolisa.dev)

There is not a lot of great font choices for developers. Mono Lisa looks very modern, supports all ligatures that some developers love (some hate), nice wider footprint and is presented on a stunning presentational website. Check this one out.

## [npm is joining GitHub](https://github.blog/2020-03-16-npm-is-joining-github/)

GitHub acquires npm! Main focus after the deal closes will be to improve the platform infrastructure, make the core experiences better and engage more with JavaScript community. In a long run we may expect massively improved security of a registry and smoother integration with GitHub Packages. 

> The amazing energy and creativity of millions of JavaScript developers is evident every day in the work that appears in npm. We are honored to support that community in a new way. The future of npm and the JavaScript ecosystem is very bright.

## [Different Favicon for Development](https://css-tricks.com/different-favicon-for-development/)

Chris Coyier gives a great tip to differentiate a production and development websites. Apart from a great tip he expresses his frustration about the favicon standard and I cannot agree more with this gentleman. 

## [CSS :nth-of-class selector](https://www.bram.us/2020/03/16/css-nth-of-class-selector/)

The `:nth-of-class` CSS selector is one of the most frequently requested features. Turns out that there is a feature that will help us to achieve this (and a lot more). This great article by [Bram(us) Van Damme](https://twitter.com/bramusblog) explains it very well.

## [CSS Can Influence Screenreaders](https://blog.benmyers.dev/css-can-influence-screenreaders/)

Shocking impact of CSS on screen readers. Ben Myers did a fantastic job of illustrating potential accessibility issue that we may accidentally introduce by CSS. One of the best accessibility articles that I have read in a while.
