One of the outcomes of abandoning social media is the excess of free time that you have. I'm not the type of person who will spend their downtime watching a new Netflix show, so I decided to get into the rabbit hole of stocks trading. There is a little problem though â€” I know nothing about it. It's never too late!

Looking for some resources to explore this new and unknown interest I came across ["A Beginner's Guide to the Stock Market" by Matthew R. Kratter](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45996732-a-beginner-s-guide-to-the-stock-market). All the initial concepts necessary to start exploring the subject are well explained in this book's initial chapters. Using simple analogies, the author describes many practical strategies for beginners and warns against easy to fall into traps. Even though the audiobook version is only 1 hour and 42 minutes, I had to listen to a few chapters multiple times to understand the concept fully. Having a physical copy of this one is advisable as it is a bit easier to digest some of the acronym-dense chapters.

Overall, it is a quick and easy book to get into stocks trading. If you have any learning resource recommendations for stock newbies like me, [ping me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/pawelgrzybek/) or use a comments section below, please. Until next time geeks!
