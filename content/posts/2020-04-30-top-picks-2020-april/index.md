## [Introducing 1.1.1.1 for Families](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-1-1-1-1-for-families/)

Introduced two years ago secure DNS server by Cloudflare became my default resolver. They went step further with this idea and introduced multiple variations of this service dedicated to families. Free of malware `1.1.1.2` and  `1.1.1.3` stripped down from adult content. Amazing idea for households with kids!

## [CSS Findings From The New Facebook Design](https://ishadeed.com/article/new-facebook-css/)

Curious [Ahmad Shadeed](https://twitter.com/shadeed9) found a lot of interesting CSS patterns in a new Facebook design. Apart from pointing them out, he listed reasons why Facebook engineers decided to use particular solution.

Great talk about the mocking. Full of great practical tips for the design of an application. I like the vibe of a talk and Justin's charisma.

## [GitHub is now free for teams](https://github.blog/2020-04-14-github-is-now-free-for-teams/)

## [Understanding TypeScript’s type notation](https://2ality.com/2018/04/type-notation-typescript.html)

I should have read this article by [Dr. Axel Rauschmayer](https://twitter.com/rauschma) before I spent ages on [official TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home). This is a fantastic explanation of the way how TypeScript types notation works.

## [100vh in iOS Safari](https://twitter.com/AllThingsSmitty/status/1254151507412496384)

[Matt Smith](https://twitter.com/AllThingsSmitty) shared a CSS trick that made my day! I am sure you noticed the annoying way how Safari on iOS calculates `100vh`. We finally have a solution that gives us a bit more predictable results. Thanks to the `height: -webkit-fill-available` declaration.
