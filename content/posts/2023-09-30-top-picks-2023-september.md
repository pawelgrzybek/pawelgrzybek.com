## [Announcing Biome](https://biomejs.dev/blog/annoucing-biome#enters-biome)

Rome, a project announced a few years ago that was meant to resolve all JavaScript developers' problems, has gone quiet. Fortunately, there is a strong community of open-source developers who have decided to continue working on the idea. Biome is a fork of Rome, which is a toolchain made for JavaScript and TypeScript developers. It includes a linter, formatter, bundler, test runner, and more. This article reveals some historical news about the decision that was made and introduces the new project and team behind it.

## [Introducing the 100-Year Plan: Secure Your Online Legacy for a Century](https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/08/25/introducing-the-100-year-plan/)

Matt Mullenweg shared this news about the new plan on WordPress.com that is going to keep your domain alive, provide top-tier hosting, and offer customer support for the next 100 years. Yes, you read that right—100 years! Taking into account the current inflation rate, it's a pretty good deal if you plan to keep your website alive for longer than your lifetime (statistically speaking).

## [An Overview of 25+ UI Component Libraries in 2023](https://www.builder.io/blog/25-plus-ui-component-libraries)

Yoav Ganbar from the Builder.io team has compiled an extensive list of UI frameworks for React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, and other popular web frameworks. A few weeks ago, I was searching for a list like this, and perhaps you are in the same situation now.

## [Making Sense of React Server Components](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/server-components/)

Joshua Comeau is a prolific writer. This post just blew my mind—hard subjects explained in such simple words, with interactive diagrams and practical examples. I didn't even know that I had so many questions about RSC until I read this article. Incredible work!

## [JavaScript WTF: Why does every() return true for empty arrays?](https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2023/09/javascript-wtf-why-does-every-return-true-for-empty-array/)

What is the relationship between programming languages like JavaScvript and [Universal Quantification theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_quantification)? Nicholas C. Zakas explains it all in one of his most recent articles. I also learned about [Vacuous truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth) after reading this post.

## [Bun 1.0](https://bun.sh/blog/bun-v1.0)

Official release of Bun 1.0 has just landed. Some of the statistics of this modern JavaScript runtime are impressive. TypeScript file execution is much faster than other popular options. Module installation is incredibly quick compared to `npm`, `yarn`, or even `pnpm`. Running scripts also surpasses other tools. On top of that, it comes with a bunch of `Bun`-specific APIs that are real-life improvements. It serves as a bundler, test runner, drop-in replacement for `node` and `npm`, and more. Now it is also available for Windows users. Solid release! For those who prefer a video format, please check out the release video below.

## [WebKit Features in Safari 17.0](https://webkit.org/blog/14445/webkit-features-in-safari-17-0/)

Safari 17 has arrived with a range of new features. The new HTML `search` element and the `popover` attribute simplify overlays, popups, popovers, and dialogs. The `hr` rules are now valid inside `select` elements to separate related `option`s. In terms of CSS, there are new features such as `font-size-adjust` and support for `@counter-style`. The Storage API and offscreen canvas are the most significant additions to the WebKit JS engine in this iteration. Additionally, the new `Set` operation methods are also welcomed! JPEG XL and HEIC media formats have also been introduced. It's a very solid release!

## [Now available: Save and sign in with passkeys using 1Password in the browser and on iOS](https://blog.1password.com/save-use-passkeys-web-ios/)

The most efficient code is the one that doesn't exist. The same rule can apply to passwords - the ones that don't exist are the most secure. I'm sure you've heard about passkeys before. ["Move beyond passwords"](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10106/), presented at WWDC 2021, was likely my initial introduction to this technology. I'm glad that two years later, the passwordless reality has hit the mainstream with this beautiful implementation of 1Password. Also, I'm surprised at how many websites already support it—just have a look at [Passkeys.directory](https://passkeys.directory).
