## [Announcing Biome](https://biomejs.dev/blog/annoucing-biome#enters-biome)

Rome, a project announced a few years ago meant to resolve all JavaScript developers’ problems, has gone quiet. Fortunately, a strong community of open-source developers has decided to continue working on the idea. Biome is a fork of Rome, a toolchain made for JavaScript and TypeScript developers. It includes a linter, formatter, bundler, test runner, and more. This article reveals historical news about the decision and introduces the new project and the team behind it.

## [Introducing the 100-Year Plan: Secure Your Online Legacy for a Century](https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/08/25/introducing-the-100-year-plan/)

Matt Mullenweg shared this news about the new plan on WordPress.com that will keep your domain alive, provide top-tier hosting, and offer customer support for the next 100 years. Yes—100 years! Considering the current inflation rate, it’s a pretty good deal if you plan to keep your website alive longer than your lifetime (statistically speaking).

## [An Overview of 25+ UI Component Libraries in 2023](https://www.builder.io/blog/25-plus-ui-component-libraries)

Yoav Ganbar from the Builder.io team has compiled an extensive list of UI frameworks for React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, and other popular web frameworks. A few weeks ago, I searched for a list like this, and perhaps you are in the same situation now.

## [Making Sense of React Server Components](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/server-components/)

Joshua Comeau is a prolific writer. This post just blew my mind—complicated subjects explained in such simple words, with interactive diagrams and practical examples. I didn’t know I had so many questions about RSC until I read this article. Incredible work!

## [JavaScript WTF: Why does every() return true for empty arrays?](https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2023/09/javascript-wtf-why-does-every-return-true-for-empty-array/)

What is the relationship between programming languages like JavaScvript and [Universal Quantification theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_quantification)? Nicholas C. Zakas explains it all in one of his most recent articles. I also learned about the [Vacuous truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth) after reading this post.

## [Bun 1.0](https://bun.sh/blog/bun-v1.0)

The official release of Bun 1.0 has just landed. Some of the statistics of this modern JavaScript runtime are impressive. TypeScript file execution is much faster than other popular options. Module installation is speedy compared to npm, yarn, or even pnpm. Running scripts also surpasses other tools. On top of that, it comes with a bunch of Bun-specific APIs that are real-life improvements. It is a bundler, test runner, drop-in replacement for node and npm, and more. Now, it is also available for Windows users. Solid release! Please check out the release video below for those who prefer a video format.

## [WebKit Features in Safari 17.0](https://webkit.org/blog/14445/webkit-features-in-safari-17-0/)

Safari 17 has arrived with a range of new features. The new HTML search element and the `popover` attribute simplify overlays, popups, popovers, and dialogs. The `hr` rules are now valid inside select pieces to separate related options. Regarding CSS, there are new features such as `font-size-adjust` and support for `@counter-style`. The Storage API and offscreen canvas are the most significant additions to the WebKit JS engine in this iteration. Additionally, the new Set operation methods are also welcomed! JPEG XL and HEIC media formats have also been introduced. It’s an excellent release!

## [Now available: Save and sign in with passkeys using 1Password in the browser and on iOS](https://blog.1password.com/save-use-passkeys-web-ios/)

The most efficient code is the one that doesn’t exist. The same rule can apply to passwords - the ones that don’t exist are the most secure. I’m sure you’ve heard about passkeys before. ["Move beyond passwords"](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10106/), presented at WWDC 2021, was likely my initial introduction to this technology. I’m glad that the passwordless reality has hit the mainstream two years later with this beautiful implementation of 1Password. Also, I’m surprised at how many websites already support it—look at [Passkeys.directory](https://passkeys.directory).

## [TypeScript Origins: The Documentary](https://youtu.be/U6s2pdxebSo?si=FMYbulbpeeijSVjH)

Very well done! It's a full-blown documentary about TypeScript, featuring interviews with the creators and early adopters. It delves into the history and motivation behind creating this new programming language. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
