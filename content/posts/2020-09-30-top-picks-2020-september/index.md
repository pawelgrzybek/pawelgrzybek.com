## [TypeScript + React: Why I don't use React.FC](https://fettblog.eu/typescript-react-why-i-dont-use-react-fc/)

[Stefan Baumgartner](https://twitter.com/ddprrt) shares a few solid reasons to reconsider using `React.FC<>` on your next TypeScript project. I have been using for quite a while now and very rarely come across issues identified in this post, but definitely, it is wort to reconsider.

## [Preload late-discovered Hero images faster](https://addyosmani.com/blog/preload-hero-images/)

[Addy Osmani](https://twitter.com/addyosmani/) already shared multiple helpful resources about preload and pre-connect. This one blew my mind — you can preload responsive images using `imagesrcset` and `imagesizes` attributes. Wow!

## [Panic - Nova](https://nova.app)

I am a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) die-hard lover not because it the developers' dream but because simply there is not a different option that helps me to do my job. It is amazing to see a new player in the space of code editors. Nova by Panic, the company behind other tools that I like and use. I am sure it will trigger a healthy competition between products and naturally make code editors space better.

## [AVIF has landed](https://jakearchibald.com/2020/avif-has-landed/)

[Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake) compares the new image format to the older alternatives. Deep dive into pros and cons and tons of interesting facts about the graphics compression in general. Great read!

## [GitHub CLI 1.0 is now available](https://github.blog/2020-09-17-github-cli-1-0-is-now-available/)

GitHub CLI finally hit stable version 1.0. This command-line tool allows us to run the whole GitHub workflow without leaving the Terminal. From creating issues, browsing merge requests to checking pipeline checks. Sweet!

## [v3.0.0 One Piece](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/releases/tag/v3.0.0)

It has finally arrived, Vue 3.0 is here. Filled with a bunch of new concepts and ideas and to top it off, amazing brand new documentation. Even though I am more a React dude, I like what is happening in the Vue community. 

## [Please Stop Writing Your Own User Authentication Code](https://medium.com/better-programming/stop-writing-your-own-user-authentication-code-e8bb50388ec4)

About the potential risks of running your own authentication service for your app. [ItalyPaleAle](https://twitter.com/ItalyPaleAle) lists his favourite IAAS (Identity-as-a-Service) providers and describes the flow of implementing authentication.

## [Introducing the New JSX Transform](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html)

JSX is just an abstraction on top of the `React.createElement` method. This announcement presents some nice improvements to the currently existing transforms. No need to import `React` just to use a piece JSX any more people.
