## [Light Years Ahead | The 1969 Apollo Guidance Computer](https://youtu.be/B1J2RMorJXM)

On 20 July 1969, Neil Armstrong with the crew landed humans on the moon for the first time. Even though it was more than half a century ago, the computer responsible for controlling the command module was one of the most complicated pieces of technology at the time. Software loaded on it was also very sophisticated, and it was built with few code design principles in mind.
On this fantastic talk given in 2019 at the National Museum of Computing, Robert Wills walks us through hardware and software that made up the Apollo Guidance Computer.

## [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu)

One of the class run during MIT's "Independent Activities Period" in January 2020 was "The Missing Semester of Your CS Education" hosted by [Anish Athalye](https://twitter.com/anishathalye), [Jon Gjengset](https://twitter.com/jonhoo) and [Jose Javier Gonzalez](https://twitter.com/jjgort). It is all about the tooling that we, software engineers, use all the time — shell, text editor, version control and others. This whole material has been recorded and published for the public for free — thank you for that.

> Classes teach you all about advanced topics within CS, from operating systems to machine learning, but there’s one critical subject that’s rarely covered, and is instead left to students to figure out on their own: proficiency with their tools. We’ll teach you how to master the command-line, use a powerful text editor, use fancy features of version control systems, and much more!

## [Google AMP is dead! AMP pages no longer get preferential treatment in Google search](https://plausible.io/blog/google-amp)

Since the day that Google announced AMP I absolutely hated this idea. I was a strong believer in using the Web platform in a way it should be used — valuable unique content and semantic HTML. Back then I was right, I am right today about it and I am happy to see this technology dying now. Google will no longer rank your pages higher if you are not supporting this ridiculous technology.

## [DOM Events](https://domevents.dev)

Just look at this DOM events explored created by [Alex Reardon](https://twitter.com/alexandereardon). Really awesome way of learning the concept in very interactive way. I love little resources like this one!

## [Announcing CodeSandbox has Acquired Play.js, a Native JavaScript IDE for iOS](https://codesandbox.io/post/codesandbox-acquires-playjs)

I recently ordered new iPad Pro 1TB and I am looking forward for it to arrive. After reading this announcement from CodeSandbox team I feel even more pumped! Literally I am looking forward to play around with CodeSandbox on iPadOS!
