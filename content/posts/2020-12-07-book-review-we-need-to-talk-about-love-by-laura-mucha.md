What should you look for in a partner? Why do people cheat? How do you know when it’s a good or right time to split with a partner? Does love at first sight exist? Is it love at all or just lust? These and a lot of other questions arrived after a relationship crisis that I went through a not such a long time ago. I decided to dig to find answers for some of these questions and get to know myself a tad better. After quick reconnaissance, I found ["We Need to Talk About Love" by Laura Mucha](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53723048-we-need-to-talk-about-love) that looked like a great publication to help in fulfilling my curiosity.

Based on psychological facts, statistics and interviews with hundreds of people from 40 countries, Laura analyse inconvenient subjects like dating, cheating, sex and other aspects of relationships, including marriage. It’s full of great story telling and the whole piece is well-written and narrated. Upfront, honest and truthful. I really recommend this book to everyone who wants to boost some self-awareness and potentially improve the quality of a relationship.
