## [Mac VoiceOver Testing the Simple Way](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/mac-voiceover-testing-the-simple-way/)

[Scott Vandehey](https://twitter.com/spaceninja) published this super simple guide to using basic features of macOS VoiceOver. This article clearly explains three simple methods that won’t take much time to perform but will help us catch critical accessibility issues on our websites.

## [John Carmack: Doom, Quake, VR, AGI, Programming, Video Games, and Rockets | Lex Fridman Podcast #309](https://youtu.be/I845O57ZSy4)

This is a very inspiring conversation between one of my favourite podcasters, Lex Fridman and a legendary John Carmack, the creator of games that revolutionised the industry and lives of many of us. Five hours of chat full of great insights from one of the most famous software engineers ever.

## [Best practices for creating a modern npm package](https://snyk.io/blog/best-practices-create-modern-npm-package/)

[Brian Clark](https://twitter.com/_clarkio) from the Snyk team published this comprehensive guide to creating a modern npm package. It contains a simple-to-follow explanation of how to produce a package that works well with CommonJS and ECMAScript modules, basic unit tests, firing testing using GitHub Actions and how to perform security checks using Snyk. Well written and easy to follow.

## [Welcome to Linux command line for you and me!](https://lym.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

This resource is a handy guide to learning Unix shell commands. Very well written and easy to understand, and there is an excellent level of detail for every beginner to become productive quickly and for advanced users to learn a thing or two.

## [Type-Level TypeScript](https://type-level-typescript.com)

[Gabriel Vergnaud](https://twitter.com/GabrielVergnaud) is working on an excellent TypeScript course. After going through the first two chapters (the only chapters ready at the time of writing this article), this project looks very promising. However, it is probably not good to learn the basics but more for advanced users and library creators.
