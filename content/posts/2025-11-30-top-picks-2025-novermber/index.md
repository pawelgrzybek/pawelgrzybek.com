## Top picks

### [Your URL Is Your State](https://alfy.blog/2025/10/31/your-url-is-your-state.html)

Often times we don’t need a complicated storage mechanisms, state management libraries or even database. Good, old URL is a beautiful way of passing state around, and reliably works on the web since 1991. I'm sure you heard that before but, please, use the platform devs.

### [The (lazy) Git UI You Didn't Know You Need](https://www.bwplotka.dev/2025/lazygit/)

It is no secret that [I'm a huge fan of lazygit](/lazygit-the-convenience-of-gui-with-the-power-of-git-cli/), and naturally I like to see more like-minded geeks embracing this powerful TUI. Bartek’s article highlights all the good reasons why you should try it, if you’re still pursuing the masochistic practice of using the git CLI. A little side note, that you should probably try Jujutsu, but this is a story for another day.

### [Handy](https://handy.computer/)

Pretty slick little app. It is surprisingly very accurate with English and does an OK with Polish as well. I will give it a spin.

### [Color Palette Pro](https://colorpalette.pro/)

I have seen a lot of color palette generators in the past, but this one is my new winner. So useful and the design of this tool is just insanely cool. Bunch of little super tasteful animations, the gradients game here is absolutely top tier. For me, this tool is an instant bookmark!

### [The HTTP QUERY Method](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body-14.html)

The specification of HTTP is evolving and it is a good time to learn about the new `QUERY` method. It is a combination of `GET` and `POST` that takes the best traits of them. Like `GET`, it has a body and is idempotent.

> As with POST, the input to the query operation is passed as the content of the request rather than as part of the request URI. Unlike POST, however, the method is explicitly safe and idempotent, allowing functions like caching and automatic retries to operate.

### ["Time to Migrate" by Tim Bray](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/11/03/Time-to-Migrate)

A good write-up about the Frdiverse and it value from prolific contributor to the open Web, Tim Bray. I cannot agree more with Tims opinion, and for this number of reasons I treat Mastodon as my only serious social media presence. Of course, this very page is my home on the web. Some may be asking what's my take on the Bluesky which I use almost as much as I do Mastodon, but Tim also wrote ["Why Not Bluesky"](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/11/15/Not-Bluesky) about it so I don't need to. Great articles!

### [Running TypeScript Natively](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/typescript/run-natively)

As of now, three dominant server-side JavaScript runtimes (Node.js, Deno and Bun) can natively run TypeScript code. This is incredibly useful and it is a huge convenience not to worry about the transpilation process. Deno and Bun supported this from the beginning, but Node.js just unfledged this feature. Happy days!
