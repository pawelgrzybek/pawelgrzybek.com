## Top picks

### [Build Times - You should know this before choosing Next.js](https://eduardoboucas.com/posts/2025-03-25-you-should-know-this-before-choosing-nextjs/)

Eduardo Bouças from the Netlify team opened up and released his frustrations about the Next.js interoperability across host providers. Being one of the people involved in the constant backward engineering of Vercel’s framework, he has a lot of interesting points. If Next.js is the tool you are planning to use for your upcoming project, this one may change your mind a little, especially if vendor locking is your concern.

### [Item Flow, Part 1: A new unified concept for layout](https://webkit.org/blog/16587/item-flow-part-1-a-new-unified-concept-for-layout/)

This is the next iteration in the masonry layout hot debate about two competing spec ideas, one coming from Apple and the other made by Googlers. This recent post by Jen Simmons on the WebKit blog looks very promising as it resolves most of the concerns the web development crowd raised before. I am a little bit unsure about the functionality of `item-pack` inside `flex` containers and feel like the two suggested solutions introduce more issues than they solve. Also, `item-slack` sounds too funny to be part of an official spec, but it looks like the debate about renaming this one continues. I like the overall direction of merging `flex` and `grid` properties into one.
