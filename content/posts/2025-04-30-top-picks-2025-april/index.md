## Top picks

### [Build Times - You should know this before choosing Next.js](https://eduardoboucas.com/posts/2025-03-25-you-should-know-this-before-choosing-nextjs/)

Eduardo Bouças from the Netlify team opened up and released his frustrations about the Next.js interoperability across host providers. Being one of the people involved in the constant backward engineering of Vercel’s framework, he has a lot of interesting points.

This recent post by Jen Simmons on the WebKit blog looks very promising as it resolves most of the concerns the web development crowd raised before. I am a little bit unsure about the functionality of `item-pack` inside `flex` containers and feel like the two suggested solutions introduce more issues than they solve. Also, `item-slack` sounds too funny to be part of an official spec, but it looks like the debate about renaming this one continues. I like the overall direction of merging `flex` and `grid` properties into one.

The CSS `text-wrap: pretty` landed in stable Google Chrome in September 2023, and Safari is catching up only now but with a twist. The implementation between these two engines differs quite a lot. On this article Jen Simmons, explains the difference between implementations, why the differences are absolutely allowed in this case and also explains a good typography concepts needed to understand the power of the new `text-wrap` value.
