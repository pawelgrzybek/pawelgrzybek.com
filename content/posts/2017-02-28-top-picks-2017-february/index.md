## New Roadmap for Future of Publishing is Underway as W3C and IDPF Officially Combine

[https://www.w3.org/2017/01/pressrelease-idpf-w3c-combination.html.en](https://www.w3.org/2017/01/pressrelease-idpf-w3c-combination.html.en)

This is biggie! W3C responsible for technologies like HTML, CSS, SVG, XML and WCAG combines powers with IDPF that developed the EPUB standard. Future of publishing is much brighter after this announcement. Another great reason to care more about semantic and accessible markup. The difference between books and web pages gets even thinner now.

Addy Osmani about performance, who else?! Must read for all js devs. As this article clearly presents it is not always about file size. V8 is fantastic with doing an performance optimization for you but it doesn't handle every scenario. Don't dispatch your responsibilities to engine — care about it yourself. Such a great in depth read.
