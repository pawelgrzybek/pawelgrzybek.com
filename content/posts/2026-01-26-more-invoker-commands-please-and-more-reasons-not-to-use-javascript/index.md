title: "More invoker commands please, and more reasons not to use JavaScript"
summary: ""
draft: true

The rule of least power on the web incentivised using HTML before reaching for CSS, CSS before JavaScript, and bashing it onto the JS script as a last resort. Every time the web ships new features that let us shift the implementation left on the stack, I’m excited about it. In recent years, we have received a heap of CSS features that required not a trivial chunk of JS code a few years before. The Invoker commands API moved the implementation upstream up to the HTML, and I’m well pumped about it.

The invoker commands API recently landed on Safari, and now it is supported by all modern engines. This is usually the moment when I like to learn enough about the new feature so I will remember when I need it.
