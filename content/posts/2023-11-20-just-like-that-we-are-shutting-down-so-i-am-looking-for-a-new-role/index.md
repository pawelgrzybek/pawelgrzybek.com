It only took six months for [American investors](https://www.brooklyncapital.com) to acquire the [Polygon](https://polygon.technology) Nightfall division before they decided to shut it down with immediate effect. Without any prior notice, nine talented developers found themselves unemployed. Unfortunately, I was one of the people on this team.

I'm asking my fellow readers for help before seeking a new gig elsewhere. I can be an excellent addition to your team if you need a hard-working developer with a solid understanding of how the web works and a passion for web standards, accessibility and open source. In terms of frameworks, I have worked with many, but I don't have a strong attachment to any one of them. React is the one I have the most experience with. I'm passionate about sharing knowledge with others, as you can tell by the [number of articles](/posts) I've published on this page over the last few years. Learning Rust is what has been making me happy recently.

If you're looking for a 10x developer for a job title that's longer than three words and your company's sales pitch includes the word "web3", then most likely I am not a good fit.

This type of article isn't one that I am excited to publish, but I need to keep the family fed and bills paid. If you can help, please email me at [mail@pawelgrzybek.com](mailto:mail@pawelgrzybek.com) or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pgrzybek/). If you can share this article with your community, that would mean a lot to me. Thanks a lot, and wish me luck ðŸ¥°
