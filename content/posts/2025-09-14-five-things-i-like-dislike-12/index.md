In no particular order, following no particular schedule. Just a few things that I recently liked and disliked. Let's go!

1. [We shot a YouTube video about film formats on 35mm film](https://youtu.be/QYUE696k6GY). Incredible production, all shot on analogue film. This 22-minutes video must have been silly expensive! I remember buying films for my first cameras 25 years ago and it was so cheap. Nowadays, a single Kodak Portra 400 goes for around Â£20 per roll. I know photographic films and video rolls are not the same, but I'm guessing that the prices are not easy to swallow either. If you like this format, check Matt's ["Humble Pi" book](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/300640/humble-pi-by-parker-matt/9780141989143) out. It is phenomenal!
1. [The FrontRoom YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@frontroom) where a son plays some classic rap albums to his father. Super relaxing content for music geeks and both blokes are very likeable.
1. Grab a calculator, type <kbd>77345</kbd>, flip it around and you have the word "shell". Nice, right? Here you have [a doc with 344 words you can spell on a calculator](https://www.mathsquad.com/calculatorwords.pdf). Not too useful but brings joy.
1. [AeroPress Coffee Maker](https://www.aeropress.co.uk/). At home I prefer to use the [Hario V60 Dripper](https://www.hario.co.uk/collections/hario-v60-coffee-dripper) but the AeroPress is an absolute must-have accessory for every single trip. I love good coffee, but I hate shit coffee. This is what you need if you're tired of hotel coffees.
1. Folks are hyped about the rollerblade style of wheels on the office chair. Sure, softer for your flooring and pretty satisfying to roll from one corner of the room to the other. My preference is to have no wheels whatsoever! I want my office chair to stay still in place, so I replaced the wheels with these [office chair raisers](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CX212SZT). A lot better than a floating chair when I need to stay in the zone.

1. I'm not into politics, but there is just too much shit going on in the world and it is impossible to stay detached from all of it. We are a well-developed species but we still use violence to resolve conflicts. This is disgusting!
1. Apple is just about to roll out the new look across their operating systems. Liquid Glass looks fresh and modern, but it comes with a lot of issues. In some places, it is simply broken. The beta version of iOS and iPadOS is okay, but the macOS one is so buggy. So, so, so buggy!
1. Cloudflare Worker doesn't allow you to specify the Hugo version that is installed in the runtime, [like Netlify does](https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/pawelgrzybek.com/blob/master/netlify.toml#L6). This limitation requires [some crazy tricks](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/hosting-a-hugo-site-on-a-cloudflare-worker/55203) to make the Hugo page run on Cloudflare. Mehhh.
1. [The Github website is extremely slow on Safari](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/170758). I use Apple's browser as my daily driver and I experience this pain daily. For smaller PRs, it is bearable, but for chunkier ones, the GitHub UI is no longer usable.
1. The price of the [Kinesis Advantage360 Professional in the UK](https://ergonomics.co.uk/shop/keyboards/type/split-keyboards/kinesis-advantage360-professional-bluetooth-keyboard-2), which is 60% more expensive than in the US market. I would love to get one.
