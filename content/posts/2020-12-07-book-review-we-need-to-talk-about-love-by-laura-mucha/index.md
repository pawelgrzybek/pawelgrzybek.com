Based on psychological facts, statistics and interviews with hundreds of people from 40 countries, Laura analyse inconvenient subjects like dating, cheating, sex and other aspects of relationships, including marriage. It’s full of great story telling and the whole piece is well-written and narrated. Upfront, honest and truthful. I really recommend this book to everyone who wants to boost some self-awareness and potentially improve the quality of a relationship.
