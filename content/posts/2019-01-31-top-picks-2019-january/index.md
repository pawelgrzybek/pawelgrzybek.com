## [Making Future Interfaces: Algorithmic Layouts](https://youtu.be/qOUtkN6M52M)

[Heydon Pickering](https://twitter.com/heydonworks), a big accessible web advocate and author of my favorite book about the subject — ["Inclusive Design Patterns"](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/products/inclusive-design-patterns). He produced a lot of good video content recently but the one about modern layout techniques is outstanding. Very good breakpoint-less methods and funny sense of humor. Highly recommended to follow his YouTube channel.

GitHub with free private repositories — finally! New enterprise offer has landed too. Microsoft is doing lots of very good things recently and this one is another step that pushes software development industry forward. Up to three users collaboration on private project is the only restriction for free tier accounts. In this situation I will probably say goodby to BitBucket as this news fulfill all my private version control needs.

The [`typescript-eslint`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) monorepo contains everything that you need to start linting `.ts` files.

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is one of the most popular services provider for software engineers. The scary thing about their range of products is its number — there is no way to nail them all. This handy list gives us a brief explanation of each one of the services and provides some handy practical tips. Golden resource.
