## [Announcing Deno KV](https://deno.com/blog/kv)

The significant advantage of Quik is its familiarity for people with experience with other similar tools — JSX support, folder-based router, middlewares etc. [Qwik Crash Course by The Net Ninja on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gOUlY-uCHurFIpqogsdOnw) can be a good starting point for everyone keen to learn it.
