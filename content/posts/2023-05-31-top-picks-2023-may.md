## [Crafting the Next.js Website](https://rauno.me/craft/nextjs)

One of the creators of the most recent version Next.js websites shared his experience and process of making some challenging design elements. The UI elements selected for this article are well-thought, and I learned a few new things. The Next.js website is stunning!

## [Announcing Deno KV](https://deno.com/blog/kv)

[The "Forced Optimization" talk by Ryan Dahl, presented at the Node Congress](https://youtu.be/LVEGRj3RZSA), teased the new Deno KV store. It is a simple key-value database that gives Deno developers a way to make their applications persistent without relying on external services that typically defeat the advantages of using Deno Deploy. This article provides a few practical examples, goes through the basic API and reveals some future plans.

## [Introducing storage on Vercel](https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-storage)

Holly moly. I barely finished reading about the Deno KV, and the news about the new Vercel storage options came out. Vercel KV (Redis), Vercel Postgres (SQL database) and Vercel Blob (based on the Cloudflare R2 files at the edge).

## [Qwik Reaches v1.0](https://www.builder.io/blog/qwik-v1)

A stable release 1.0 of the new generation web framework, Qwik, just landed. Compared to other popular frameworks such as React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, and SolidJS, this one takes a slightly different approach regarding the amount of JavaScript delivered to the browser at the startup. Speculative code fetching delivers the code only when it is needed. The significant advantage of Quik is its familiarity for people with experience with other similar tools — JSX support, folder-based router, middlewares etc. [Qwik Crash Course by The Net Ninja on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gOUlY-uCHurFIpqogsdOnw) can be a good starting point for everyone keen to learn it.

## [Unsolved Tetris Mysteries With Creator Alexy Pajitnov & Designer Henk Rogers](https://youtu.be/6YhkkyXydNI)

The original creator of Tetris, Alexey Pajitnov, and his partner Henk Rogers, who helped to introduce this game to the masses, answer questions about the game. What is the canonical version, what programming language was used to create the first version, what are their favourite gaming patterns, etc.?

## [Modern HTML email (tables no longer required)](https://fullystacked.net/posts/modern-html-email/)

Coding mail templates is very different from working on static websites, and it was always a daunting task due to the restrictions of email clients. Luckily, this article by Ollie Williams explains why the situation is better than it used to be and how to make the process more enjoyable.

## [The Dangers of Google’s .zip TLD](https://medium.com/@bobbyrsec/the-dangers-of-googles-zip-tld-5e1e675e59a5)

Google recently announced new Top-Level Domains (TLDs), one of which is `.zip`. This regrettable choice can lead to a lot of confusion, but most importantly, to security issues. This article explains why.

## [Introduction to design systems](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx6vqOWJSWH87Zb5-riiG63A)

Figma revolutionized how designers work and is an excellent tool for creating design systems. This playlist by Figma is a great starting point for everyone who wants to learn more about this topic, from fundamental concepts, building and testing, to documenting your system and everything in between! This is also great material for front-end developers who want to improve collaboration with designers.
