## [Crafting the Next.js Website](https://rauno.me/craft/nextjs)

One of the creators of the most recent version Next.js websites shared his experience and process of making some challenging design elements. The UI elements selected for this article are well-thought, and I learned a few new things. The Next.js website is stunning!

## [Announcing Deno KV](https://deno.com/blog/kv)

[The "Forced Optimization" talk by Ryan Dahl, presented at the Node Congress](https://youtu.be/LVEGRj3RZSA), teased the new Deno KV store. It is a simple key-value database that gives Deno developers a way to make their applications persistent without relying on external services that typically defeat the advantages of using Deno Deploy. This article provides a few practical examples, goes through the basic API and reveals some future plans.

## [Introducing storage on Vercel](https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-storage)

Holly moly. I barely finished reading about the Deno KV, and the news about the new Vercel storage options came out. Vercel KV (Redis), Vercel Postgres (SQL database) and Vercel Blob (based on the Cloudflare R2 files at the edge).

## [Qwik Reaches v1.0](https://www.builder.io/blog/qwik-v1)

A stable release 1.0 of the new generation web framework, Qwik, just landed. Compared to other popular frameworks such as React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, and SolidJS, this one takes a slightly different approach regarding the amount of JavaScript delivered to the browser at the startup. Speculative code fetching delivers the code only when it is needed. The significant advantage of Quik is its familiarity for people with experience with other similar tools — JSX support, folder-based router, middlewares etc. [Qwik Crash Course by The Net Ninja on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gOUlY-uCHurFIpqogsdOnw) can be a good starting point for everyone keen to learn it.
