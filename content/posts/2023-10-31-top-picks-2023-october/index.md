## [Limit the reach of your selectors with the CSS @scope at-rule](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/at-scope)

People struggle to embrace the cascade part of CSS, so plenty of solutions have evolved to limit the reach of CSS selectors. Various naming conventions like BEM and a number of CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components have helped to work around it. Finally, we have a native solution to limit the access of CSS selectors—the `@scope` at-rule. Bramus did a splendid job explaining how it works and how to use it. So far, [the browser support for `@scope`](https://caniuse.com/?search=%40scope) is limited to Google Chrome 118, and I am unsure about the implementation status in other engines.

## [Engage a Wider Audience With ActivityPub on WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/10/11/activitypub/)

A ton of great improvements just landed in the Netlify Functions API. It introduces a new standardized interface, configurable endpoints using a config object, advanced routing via named groups, method matching, and simplified streaming. Using Netlify Functions now feels more like using the web and less like interacting with AWS Lambda. It's a nice move, and I love the flexibility that the config object enables.
