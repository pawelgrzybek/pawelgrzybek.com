It feels like I published ["A look back at 2021"](/a-look-back-at-2021/) yesterday. Time flies! Even though I had no bigger plans for 2022, this year brought many changes in my personal and professional life. Let me use this one-of-a-year occasion to share some of my past year's highlights. But before that, here are a bunch of random photos from 2022 for lazy people who don't want to read the whole post.

## Professional

Not too long ago, I bragged about [joining Heydoc](/thanks-for-everything-mindera-hi-heydoc/), but I decided to make a change one more time due to a never-ending lookup for a challenge. So in September, [I joined Polygon](/i-am-joining-polygon/) as a Software Engineer. Since then, it has been quite a journey â€” I learned a ton, and I still have a lot to learn. A new job gave me the challenge I asked for and plenty of opportunities to work with new technologies. Also, my new team is incredible. Although we are a fully remote company, we managed to hook up in Istanbul and spend quality time with each other.

My plan of writing more non-JS production-ready code changed a little since I joined the cryptography space with no freakin' clue what it is about. I am getting better at it, and it took me quite some time to grasp it to the point where I am actually enjoying it. I still enjoy learning and building useless stuff using Rust and other new-to-me technologies.

## Personal

Let's start with a word about my personal website. Each year I feel that I won't be able to do as well as the year before, and I surprise myself every year. This year I published 49 articles, the same as I did a year ago. I am also proud of the diversity of topics in my posts (front end, backend, tooling, new explorations from tech overall, books and even some woodworking). Also, the number of unique visitors went up by around 20%. At this point, let me use the opportunity of having you here (yes, you, my reader) and thank you from the bottom of my heart for reading and sharing!

Speaking of woodworking. At the begging of the year, I started watching tons of woodworking-related videos on YouTube. I got inspired by my father, who does the same thing but is more into steelwork. I found it calming to the point that I decided to try it myself. I bought some basic tools (track saw, router, some measuring and finishing accessories), and without fucking around, I started making things. I built tables, plant stools, record shelves and frames for our friends and us. I screwed things up so many times! I learned how to slow down, be patient and persistent. Another important outcome is a balance between good enough and a blind race for perfection. It was fun! Plenty more to come!

Last but not least, at the age of 35, I became a house owner. We have a beautiful, 122 years old victorian house located in the most beautiful area of Northampton (UK). A lot of work is coming in the following months, and I am well excited about it. I feel like a real grown-up now!

## I need a change in 2023

For the most part, 2022 was a very successful year for me, but there is no rose without a thorn. Last year was also the busiest year of my life. Changing jobs, moving out, being by my girl's side in the most important events in her life, dealing with cancer in the family, loss of grandma and many more. All these events required constant focus and dedication, but I forgot about quite an essential part â€” me!

I don't care how selfish it sounds, but the next year I want to stay focused more on myself. I neglected my mental and physical health, so it is a good time to recover. I want to spend more time with my friends and family, travel and exercise regularly. In addition, I want to resolve my insomnia and obsessive overthinking about things I can't control once and for good.

I wish you all a happy new year and a great 2023 ðŸŽ‰
