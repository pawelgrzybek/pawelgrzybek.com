I love the "5 things I like right now" series of posts by [Mike Crittenden](https://critter.blog). So, inspired by it, I started sharing some things I like/dislike occasionally. No particular schedule and no limitation about the stuff I write about — I am just having fun sharing some cool shit with you all!

## Disliked

1. Drainage from the toilet, sink, and bath on the outside of houses in the UK
1. Restaurants with a lengthy menu
1. Blogs without an RSS feed
1. Oil-based paints (water-based paints are durable enough, dry quicker and smell nice)
1. The eero WiFi routers have no web interface (iOS/Android app only)
