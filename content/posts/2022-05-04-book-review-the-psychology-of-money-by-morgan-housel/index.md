A few years ago, I started taking my finances more seriously. I stopped spending every penny on vinyl records and beers and started to explore investing. Since then, I have deepened my knowledge and constantly adjusted my strategy. I naturally developed an interest in the subject and began reading books and following influencers in this field. ["The Psychology of Money" by Morgan Housel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41881472-the-psychology-of-money) was on my wishlist for quite a while, so finally, I decided to read/listen to it.

"The Psychology of Money" is an easy-to-follow book consisting of several micro-stories full of educational insights. It goes in-depth about the real meaning of wealth, happiness, luck, greed and vanity. However, it's not a blueprint for another investing technique, nor is it dense in financial data.

It wasn't a revolutionary book for me, and that's fine because I didn't expect it to be. Nevertheless, It served as a good reminder of critical psychological factors in dealing with money. The anecdotes that this book is full of are also helpful to becoming a better human being, not only a finance manager.
