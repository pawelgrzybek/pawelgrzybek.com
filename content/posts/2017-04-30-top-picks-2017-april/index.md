I really don't know what is going on but on the beginning of an April so many people across all social media channels started exchanging their links to profile on totally new social media channel — Mastodon. Of course [I have my own account](https://mastodon.social/@pawelgrzybek) by now! Author of Mastodon published a nice primer and pointed out the differences between micro-blogging platforms that we tend to use. The growing pace looks very promising for this platform. The most important benefits for me are — open source, free and decentralized. I'm very curious what will future bring to the Mastodon!

Do you remember [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/)? It was a big thing when flexbox arrived to browsers. It has been a while since we got a solid layout update spec across all vendors. CSS Grid Module landed just month ago and Thomas Park again made our life much easier to grasp the basic concept of it. Grow your carrots and enjoy 24 levels of interactive game that will teach you a basic grid syntax. Such a good fun!

Yeah boy, we have a CSS custom properties in all major browsers now. The future is now! In my opinion the most powerful feature ever added to Cascade Style Sheets. I already saw so many amazing examples that take an advantage of this and I'm looking forward to see more of them.
