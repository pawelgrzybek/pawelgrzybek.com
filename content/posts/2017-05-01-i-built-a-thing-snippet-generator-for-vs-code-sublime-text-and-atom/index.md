title: I built a thing - Snippet Generator for VS Code, Sublime Text and Atom
summary: Snippets — probably the most powerful feature of code editors. I love using them but I don't like creating them manually. Let me simplify things a little bit.

Snippets — one of the most powerful features of my code editor. I use these reusable chunks of code constantly. Over the years I've built a huge collection of snippets for Sublime Text. Then I used Atom for a little while and eventually ended up using Visual Studio Code. All of these tools allow us to boost productivity by using custom snippets — if you're not using them yet I highly recommend embracing the power. There is one thing that really sucks about snippets though — creating them. I found it especially painful in VS Code because it splits each line into a separated string. I decided to simplify the process a little bit…

[Snippet Generator](https://pawelgrzybek.com/snippet-generator/) is a tiny React app that makes it much easier and more user-friendly. The source code for the app is available [on Github](https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/snippet-generator). Don't judge me — I'm not React expert but it's been a fun to build something with it. If you have any ideas for improvements, suggestions or bugs to report, use Github issues please. Enjoy :-)
