Northampton is a lovely town in central England between London and Birmingham. It has a rich culture, great art, a good music scene, and plenty of tech firms. Ever since I moved to Northampton 12 years ago, I have always missed one thing - we don‚Äôt have a space for developers to hang out, socialise, and share knowledge. I don‚Äôt know what I am doing, but I am organising a meetup and hope to change it üôà

## Northamptonshire Dev Club

The idea behind [Northamptonshire Dev Club](https://nn1.dev) is to bring local like-minded geeks together, socialise and learn from each other. It is deliberately technology, language or framework agnostic to attract more people and broaden our horizons. Whether part of an engineering or design team, product manager, or tester, you should find something for yourself.

If you need more of a reason to join, we have speakers! For the first event, we have incredible speakers aligned, and more amazing people are keen to give a talk to support the growth of our local community! Keep up with the upcoming events on [our website](https://nn1.dev) (nn1.dev is a sick domain name, right?).

### Let‚Äôs kick things off on the 27th of March at Vulcal Works

I would love to invite you all to a first event on the 27th of March at Vulcan Works. We have incredible speakers, time for networking, beers, soft drinks, pizza and other cool perks for you all prepared. Most importantly, this is all for free, and it will always be free for you lovely geeks!

Speaking of incredible speakers. If you are into IOT (Internet of Things), I cannot think of a better speaker than [PJ Evans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrpjevans/) from the Mindera team. [Dr Junade Ali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/junade/) is also joining us to walk us through the results of his recent research about the health of software engineering teams.

Mark this date in your calendar, tell your friends and join us, please! The only thing you need to do is [reserve a free spot on the Eventbrite event page](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/nn1-dev-club-tickets-852315477537).

- Location: [Vulcan Works, 34-38 Guildhall Rd, Northampton, NN1 1EW](https://vulcanworks.co.uk/)
- Date/Time: Wednesday, 27/03/2024, 18:00

After the event, we can continue at the [Maule Collective](http://maulebrewing.com/maule-collective-bar/), enjoying a few beers at the local taproom. It is just up the hill from Vulcan Works. In contrast to the first part of the event, this will never be free üçª

## Thanks

As I said at the beginning, I don‚Äôt know what I am doing, but luckily, I have incredible friends who are fantastic at what they do. A massive shout to [Darren Sharp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/staffordsharp/), who handled the complex parts of organising an event. Huge thanks to [Vulcan Works](https://vulcanworks.co.uk/) for supporting the idea and providing incredible space. Thanks to my talented friend [Marcin Uscinowicz](https://uscinowi.cz), who designed a beautiful logo for us.
