## [Sass in the Browser](https://sass-lang.com/blog/sass-in-the-browser/)

Better late than never. The only reason people would like to use Less over Sass was the ability to compile it in the browser. Now Sass can do it too. With the natively supported nesting and custom properties (CSS variables), it is not as appealing anymore, but it is still a nice to have.

## [Modern Software Development Summarized](https://factoryfactoryfactory.net)

Just on point! Not only funny, but also super real.

## [I am leaving](https://briefs.video/videos/i-am-leaving/)

The current state of social media platforms in one short video. Beautiful work by Heydon.

## [CEO Announcement to the Netlify team](https://www.netlify.com/blog/ceo-announcement-to-the-netlify-team/)

One of my favorite companies in the web ecosystem is going through hard times. It is quite devastating to see the best proponents of JAMstack and the web, in general, struggling. A very nice explanation of the current business situation was given by the CEO, Matt Biilmann.

## [The syndicate](https://adactio.com/journal/20323)

Following the social media drama that we are all experiencing, Jeremy Keith shares his approach. The only social media profile is your personal website; others are just syndication channels. Brilliant!

## [CSS Findings From The Threads App](https://ishadeed.com/article/threads-app-css/)

Ahmad Shadeed shares interesting CSS findings from the Threads app. I love his series of posts where he explores the codebases of popular social media platforms and shares intriguing insights. I truly admire Ahmad's curiosity and meticulous attention to detail.
