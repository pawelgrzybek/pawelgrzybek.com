### ["A Website To End All Websites" by Henry Desroches](https://henry.codes/writing/a-website-to-destroy-all-websites/)

An essay about the current state of the broken web but mostly a great incentive to abandon some terrible tech and dedicate your energy to more decentralised and honest alternatives. A beautiful ode to the Indie Web. I appreciate the effort of creating a very custom design for this page. Not only is there custom design, but there is also a dedicated [a-website-to-destroy-all-websites.com](https://a-website-to-destroy-all-websites.com/) domain that proxies to this post.

### [21 Lessons From 14 Years at Google](https://addyosmani.com/blog/21-lessons/)

Addy Osmani was always a huge inspiration for me. He helped me to fall in love with the web in the early days, and I learned a ton from his books, mainly "Learning JavaScript Design Patterns," which was a huge help for my programming career. He has been at Google for as long as I can remember, and it is good to see his list of insights after working there for so many years. A bunch of invaluable advice for developers of any level.

### [It's hard to justify Tahoe icons](https://tonsky.me/blog/tahoe-icons/)

Hats off to Nikita Prokopov for this detailed research of the recent macOS Tahoe icons situation. In short, it’s a mess! A lot of unintuitive choices, an absolute lack of consistency, hilarious repetitions. The unclear ambition to assign an icon to every freaking thing is silly to start with. Nikita’s posts on a regular basis hit the top of the HackerNews board, and this one was not an exception for a good reason. It is a good post.
