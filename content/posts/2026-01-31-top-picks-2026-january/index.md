### ["A Website To End All Websites" by Henry Desroches](https://henry.codes/writing/a-website-to-destroy-all-websites/)

A beautiful essay about the current state of the web but mostly a great incentive to abandon some terrible tech and invest time in little indie communities and making the web great again. Beautiful read, Henry.
