title: "Top picks — 2026 January"
summary: ""
draft: true
---

For the past 15 years I have been writing software for multiple companies, but I have always tried to stay close to the frontend layer of the stack. This is my background and this is my passion. Recently my interest has been shifting away from working on the Web APIs, more towards backend code. I cannot articulate yet if this is because I like working with Go so much, or because I dislike working with JavaScript on the server side. One is true, I read and post more about Go. Sorry for the disappointment, Web folks, if the content of my blog doesn't align anymore with what you got used to.

Saying that, working in a few sectors using a variety of tech stacks gave me good exposure to different programming languages. While I was at Polygon, I spent a significant amount of time writing Rust code. Now, at Avant Arte, most of my days I spend in Go codebases. I don’t want to talk about my preferences here because I did that briefly in the ["Look Back at 2025"](/a-look-back-at-2025/). I would like to encourage you to try getting out of your bubble sometimes. Learning a new skill, a new programming language, or framework can give you good exposure to new paradigms, points of view, and reorder your priorities.

After this long intro totally not related to any of my picks for this month, let’s get into the meat of this monthly series. As always, a quick music recommendation for you to check out!

## Album of the month

The ["Mishaps Happening" by Quantic](https://www.discogs.com/release/297554-Quantic-Mishaps-Happening) is as fresh today as it was on the release day 22 years ago. It will never stop surprising me how diverse Quantic’s productions are. A good portion of afro beats, funk, live instruments and electronic accents are here. It is one of those albums that you just play from the beginning and you don’t have any reason to skip a song. I was well chuffed when I picked this album up in the record store that recently opened in my neighbourhood.

## Top picks

### ["A Website To End All Websites" by Henry Desroches](https://henry.codes/writing/a-website-to-destroy-all-websites/)

An essay about the current state of the broken web but mostly a great incentive to abandon some terrible tech and dedicate your energy to more decentralised and honest alternatives. A beautiful ode to the Indie Web. I appreciate the effort of creating a very custom design for this page. Not only is there custom design, but there is also a dedicated [a-website-to-destroy-all-websites.com](https://a-website-to-destroy-all-websites.com/) domain that proxies to this post.

### [21 Lessons From 14 Years at Google](https://addyosmani.com/blog/21-lessons/)

Addy Osmani was always a huge inspiration for me. He helped me to fall in love with the web in the early days, and I learned a ton from his books, mainly "Learning JavaScript Design Patterns," which was a huge help for my programming career. He has been at Google for as long as I can remember, and it is good to see his list of insights after working there for so many years. A bunch of invaluable advice for developers of any level.

### [It's hard to justify Tahoe icons](https://tonsky.me/blog/tahoe-icons/)

Hats off to Nikita Prokopov for this detailed research of the recent macOS Tahoe icons situation. In short, it’s a mess! A lot of unintuitive choices, an absolute lack of consistency, hilarious repetitions. The unclear ambition to assign an icon to every freaking thing is silly to start with. Nikita’s posts on a regular basis hit the top of the HackerNews board, and this one was not an exception for a good reason. It is a good post.

### [Go 1.26 interactive tour](https://antonz.org/go-1-26/)

The upcoming release 1.26 of the Go programming language is going to be a huge one. Anton Zhiyanov published this interactive guide with a lot of examples and explanations of all the new features and upcoming changes to the language. This is very useful for new Gophers, as the release notes from the official channels are pretty dry and very technical. I massively appreciate Anton's effort on this one.

### [The Astro Technology Company joins Cloudflare](https://astro.build/blog/joining-cloudflare/)

Recent release notes of Astro 6 Beta, where they dedicated a whole section to [Astro 6 on Cloudflare Workers](https://astro.build/blog/astro-6-beta/#spotlight-astro-6-on-cloudflare-workers) gave me a hint that something is cooking, but I didn’t expect this bomb to drop so quickly. Yeah, my favourite framework for building websites and my favourite infrastructure platform just married, and I’m well excited about this. It may remind you of the times when Netlify bought Gatsby, but this feels different to me. I host a [a local meetup in Northampton/UK](https://nn1.dev/), and everything related to it is powered by these two technologies, and not even once did I have an issue with this stack.
