title: "Title goes here"
summary: "Summary goes here."
---

- i stared my programming using some bulky visual editors like dreamwaver and other similar mostrers
- i explored sublime text and fellt in love in its speed, configurability and its simplicity
- then i joined the funclub of visual studio code and heavily soked into this space, i created a popular theme and even a helper web app to create snippets and its populary exceeded my expectations
- i still use it and this is the one that i feel the most productive using
- i would love to slim it down because it is becoming bulky and slow, so many language protocls running in the background
- also i cannot take it it anywhere with me, i canot lot in via ssh to my raspberry pi because it will explode
- never stop chaning
- amongst many vim krakkrk neovim and others i picked helix as it comes with most of the stuff i need out of the box, i dont want to invest my time and effort into another congiguration hell, super lightweight
- super easy to configure and the number of config is limited, the editor is pretty opinionated
- change feels nice
- even tho i am moving from fancy looking feature packed IDE to a simple modal based editor it feels fresh, change is good
- i am a bad typer and this one encourages me to practice my typing skills
- start with tutor and have a look at the website that goes in depth into particular subjects and lists all commands and keyboard bindings
- this is my config
- contains all i expect from a modern editor - speed, configurability, suport for languaages i use (mainly js and rust)
