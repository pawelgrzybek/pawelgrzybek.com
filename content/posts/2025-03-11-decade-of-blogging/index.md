Decade! Ten years of regular-ish publishing have passed since I published the classic ["Hello there!"](/hello-there/) and it feels pretty satisfying. Regular writing is good for so many reasons, but on this one, I elaborated two years ago in ["Eight years of blogging"](/eight-years-of-blogging/). Thinking clarity, job opportunities, improved vocabulary, and a playground to test things out are just a few of the reasons why it is great to keep a little corner of the internet just for yourself. It was only two years ago, but damn, what kind of absurdly crazy two years they were!

Today a little bit ranty list of challenges for creators nowadays and how to stay motivated to pursue. It contains some spicy takes on some of the things you may love, but this is my blog and I can write whatever I want here. Another good thing about having a personal website.

## Last two years

Since AI tools hit the masses in November 2022, all of a sudden everyone is a writer, artist, programmer, and music composer. This post is not about the quality of their outcomes, but in short, it is mostly shit. Folks publish hundreds of articles a day on their company website to get some extra SEO points. Spotify is flooded with autogenerated music, and [they actually promote this nonsense because of lower royalty fees](https://futurism.com/spotify-accused-promoting-ghost-artists). Innocent kids are obsessed with click-generators in the form of dancing fruits on [YouTube that spread misinformation](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/66796495). A quarter of the [students nowadays submit homework without ever proofreading it](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/18/g-s1-43115/chatgpt-teen-school-homework-classroom-ai). AI slop is everywhere!

This blog, like the majority of technical websites out there, most likely experiences the lowest traffic in history. Blogging doesn’t feel as motivational anymore. Why would someone spend hours on research to write a technical piece that barely anyone will ever read? Most of the answers to technical struggles are a few clicks away in ChatGPT, DeepSeek, or Claude chatbot, right? Even if you decide to write it down, OpenAI will suck your hard work in momentarily and resurface it in their tools without ever giving you credit for it.

Unfortunately, in real life, we still use cables to connect a MacBook to the external display. Luckily, though, I have all five fingers on my left hand. Also, I don't look like Vitalik Buterin." >}}

AI is not the only contributor to the craziness of the last two years. The anti-trans president of the economical kingdom sympathises with the cruel dictator of Russia. Pro-Nazi Elon destroys Twitter, which actually is a good thing because decentralised alternatives like [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@pawelgrzybek) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/pawelgrzybek.com) gain huge adoption. Unfortunately, Meta's SEO, who loves free speech, [blocks all links to the Fediverse-driven Pixelfed](https://techstory.in/meta-blocks-links-to-pixelfed-a-decentralized-instagram-alternative/) on his platforms.

## Step back to stay relevant

At first glance, the situation does not look like the slow process of blogging is an idea worth pursuing. Precisely the opposite is true! Critical thinking required for writing (and other acts of creation) is the only thing that can save us from becoming idiots. Microsoft, the same one that made a pretty close partnership with OpenAI, funded the interesting research about "The Impact of Generative AI on Critical Thinking."

> Moreover, while GenAI can improve worker efficiency, it can inhibit critical engagement with work and can potentially lead to long-term overreliance on the tool and diminished skill for independent problem-solving. Higher confidence in GenAI’s ability to perform a task is related to less critical thinking effort. When using GenAI tools, the effort invested in critical thinking shifts from information gathering to information verification; from problem-solving to AI response integration; and from task execution to task stewardship.

For the exact same reason why [I ditched modern coding tools](/the-joy-of-learning-helix-and-probably-other-modal-terminal-based-editors/) that want to control my actions, for the same reason I feel more motivated than ever to keep on writing. I really don't want skills that I am proud of to diminish. Despite that, it all sounds like a big rant for AI tools, I'm not against them at all. I will continue to use them for what they are good at (spell checking, generating boilerplate code, generic web search on common knowledge). They are just not allowed to get into my creative process.
