Decade! Ten years of regular-ish publishing have passed since I published the classic ["Hello there!"](/hello-there/) and it feels pretty satisfying. Regular writing is good for so many reasons, but on this one, I elaborated two years ago in ["Eight years of blogging"](/eight-years-of-blogging/). Thinking clarity, job opportunities, improved vocabulary, and a playground to test things out are just a few of the reasons why it is great to keep a little corner of the internet just for yourself. It was only two years ago, so it feels a bit redundant to write another article, but damn, what kind of absurdly crazy two years they were! I have some thoughts.

Today a little bit ranty list of challenges for creators nowadays and how to stay motivated to pursue. It contains some spicy takes on some of the things you may swear by, but this is my blog and I can write whatever I want here. Another good thing about having a personal website.

## Last two years

Since AI tools hit the masses in November 2022, all of a sudden everyone is a writer, artist, programmer, and music composer. Folks publish hundreds of articles a day on their company website to get some extra SEO points. Spotify is flooded with autogenerated music, and [they actually promote this nonsense because of lower royalty fees](https://futurism.com/spotify-accused-promoting-ghost-artists). Innocent kids are obsessed with click-generators in the form of dancing fruits on [YouTube that spread misinformation](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/66796495). A quarter of the [students nowadays submit homework without ever proofreading it](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/18/g-s1-43115/chatgpt-teen-school-homework-classroom-ai). AI slop is everywhere!

This post is not about the quality of AI tools' results, but in short, it is mostly shit. Every day you come across another successful story that someone built XYZ without writing a single line of code. Give me just one example of the app you use daily, a game that hooked you in, or any creation that you truly enjoyed that was made entirely without human touch. Just one. Exactly!

This blog, like plenty of other technical websites, experiences the lowest traffic in history. Blogging doesn’t feel as motivational anymore. Why spend hours writing a technical piece that barely anyone will ever read? Most of the answers to technical struggles are a few clicks away in ChatGPT, DeepSeek, or the Claude chatbot, right? Even if you publish a post, OpenAI will suck your hard work in momentarily and resurface it in their tools without ever giving you credit for it.

Unfortunately, in real life, we still use cables to connect a MacBook to the external display. Luckily, though, I have all five fingers on my left hand. Also, I don't look like Vitalik Buterin." >}}

AI is not the only contributor to the craziness of the last two years. The anti-trans president of the economical kingdom sympathises with the cruel dictator of Russia. Pro-Nazi Elon destroys Twitter, which actually is a good thing because decentralised alternatives like [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@pawelgrzybek) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/pawelgrzybek.com) gain huge adoption. Unfortunately, Meta's SEO, who loves free speech, [blocks all links to the Fediverse-driven Pixelfed](https://techstory.in/meta-blocks-links-to-pixelfed-a-decentralized-instagram-alternative/) on his platforms.

## Step back to stay relevant

At first glance, the situation does not look like the slow process of blogging is an idea worth pursuing. Precisely the opposite is true! Critical thinking required for writing (and other acts of creation) is the only thing that can save us from becoming idiots. Microsoft, the same one that made a pretty close partnership with OpenAI, funded the interesting research about "The Impact of Generative AI on Critical Thinking."

> Moreover, while GenAI can improve worker efficiency, it can inhibit critical engagement with work and can potentially lead to long-term overreliance on the tool and diminished skill for independent problem-solving. Higher confidence in GenAI’s ability to perform a task is related to less critical thinking effort. When using GenAI tools, the effort invested in critical thinking shifts from information gathering to information verification; from problem-solving to AI response integration; and from task execution to task stewardship.

For the exact same reason why [I ditched modern coding tools](/the-joy-of-learning-helix-and-probably-other-modal-terminal-based-editors/) that want to control my actions, for the same reason I feel more motivated than ever to keep on writing. I really don't want skills that I am proud of to diminish. Despite that, it all sounds like a big rant against AI tools, I'm not against them at all. I will continue using them for what they are good at, but I want my creative process to stay AI-free.

## Social media

Twitter is over and shame on you if you still support Elon's "free-speech" farm. Luckily, we have a lot of better alternatives. [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@pawelgrzybek) is what I use the most nowadays for a chit-chat with the rest of the IndieWeb folks. [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/pawelgrzybek.com) is another popular alternative, but because of some funding decisions the company made, I wouldn't be so sure about the ethical future of this platform.

My absolutely favourite "social" place to be on, and the one I am absolutely sure about its future, is the Web. I want my social media profile to be this very website, and a meticulously crafted list of RSS channels to be my feed. I will continue publishing here as the canonical place for things I want people to read and pictures to be seen.
