title: "Files management with Yazi"
summary: ""
---

It is no secret that I like a good TUIs (terminal user interface). Recently, I published a post about the [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) that sped up my git workflow so much. Today I wanted to show you a few demos of [Yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi), my new favorite terminal-based files manager.

Yazi is written in Rust, a files/directories manager with tons of features: preview for text files and other formats (via optional CLIs), multiple item edits, tabs, theming, configurable keyboard shortcuts, a plugin system, and plenty of others. It is a relatively new tool with [the first commit](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/commit/52aa00ed23bf458e82f92bf92310ec860bd3de9c) published only a year ago.

A a series of quick demos to get you hooked.

This is just a subset of Yazi features, but these are the ones I use most frequently. There are [plenty more TUIs](https://github.com/rothgar/awesome-tuis) to play with in the future, so stay tuned and share with me what your favorite ones are.
