It is no secret that I like good TUIs (terminal user interface). Recently, I published a post about the [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) that sped up my git workflow so much. Today I wanted to show you a few demos of [Yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io), my new favorite terminal-based files manager.

Yazi is written in Rust, a files/directories manager with tons of features: preview for text files and other formats (via optional CLIs), multiple item edits, tabs, theming, configurable keyboard shortcuts, a plugin system, and plenty of others. It is a relatively new tool with [the first commit](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/commit/52aa00ed23bf458e82f92bf92310ec860bd3de9c) published only a year ago.

A series of quick demos to get you hooked on.

{{< figure-video path="delete.mp4" caption="Select multiple items and move to trash (d) or delete (D)" >}}

{{< figure-video path="tabs.mp4" caption="Opening a new tab (t), and switching between them (1-9)" >}}
 

This is just a subset of Yazi features, but these are the ones I use most frequently. There are [plenty more TUIs](https://github.com/rothgar/awesome-tuis) to play with in the future, so stay tuned and share your favourite ones with me.
