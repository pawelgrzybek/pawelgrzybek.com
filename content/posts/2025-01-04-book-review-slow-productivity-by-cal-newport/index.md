title: 'Book review: "Slow Productivity" by Cal Newport'
summary: ""
---

It was Cal’s "Digital Minimalism" that inspired me to ditch conventional social media channels, and after two years without mindless scrolling I can only recommend you do the same. "Deep Work" by the same author helped me to refocus and understand the difference between deep and shallow work. I waited patiently for a moment of downtime to read/listen to "Slow Productivity" since I heard about it for the first time in Andrew Huberman’s podcast.

After talking to friends and reading plenty of 2024 reviews, the overall business is the common denominator. Working on multiple things at once, busy schedules, plenty of side gigs. How often do all these lead to actually meaningful achievements, other than the false perception of pseudo productivity?
