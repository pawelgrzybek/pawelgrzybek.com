I love the "5 things I like right now" series of posts by [Mike Crittenden](https://critter.blog). So, inspired by it, I decided to start sharing some things I like/dislike from time to time. No particular schedule and no limitation about the stuff I write about —  I am just having fun sharing some cool shit with you all!
