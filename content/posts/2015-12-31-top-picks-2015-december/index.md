## Leaving the Mac App Store

[http://blog.sketchapp.com/post/134322691555/leaving-the-mac-app-store](http://blog.sketchapp.com/post/134322691555/leaving-the-mac-app-store)

Sketch App just left Apple App Store. It is getting more popular recently and it doesn’t surprise me at all. Weird rules of sandboxing apps by Apple sometimes can be very restrictive for developers. I wish to see a movement like this by more big players (for example Serif with Affinity Photo and Affinity Design).

I know nothing about security, and probably even less about math but this article is so interesting tho. It present the concept of ‘polynomial time’ and ‘nondeterministic polynomial’. These are two terms that rules the security around internet. Thanks Zack Grossbart!

[Philip Walton](https://twitter.com/philwalton) from Google explains the general difference between preprocessors variables and new custom properties. This feature is already available in [Firefox and in Google Chrome](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables) behind the experimental flag. Hopefully it is going to be implemented in core of browsers because it can make our life much easier. I have so many practical use cases for this in my head, but I will keep these ideas for future article.
