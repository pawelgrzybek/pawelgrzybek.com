## [Own Your Web](https://buttondown.email/ownyourweb/)

This newsletter by Matthias Ott is one of my favorite ones, even though it's super new. The vibe, its focus, and shared resources speak to my interests so much. It's all about the Indie Web and the core building blocks of a Web platform. Nice one, Matthias!

## [The poster’s guide to the internet of the future](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/23/23928550/posse-posting-activitypub-standard-twitter-tumblr-mastodon)

The Verge team did a really good job of explaining what the issues are with the current state of social media platforms and why the good old [POSSE principle](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) is finally gaining adoption. After Elon's Twitter acquisition, Mastodon and other ActivityPub-fueled platforms finally get well-deserved traction. Also, the adoption of a protocol by WordPress.com is a massive adoption hit for this great technology. There's no better time than now to take an ownership of your content.

## [Monaspace - An innovative superfamily of fonts for code](https://monaspace.githubnext.com)

A new beutiful coding font from GitHub team has been released. It is distributed as a regular OpenType font for a desktop software, variable font with multiple configurable axis and also as a web font. Event tho it is a bunle of multiple fonts (Neon, Argon, Xenon, Radon and Krypton) they all have their own distinctive look. "Texture healing" is one of the features of this font family, and I am not sure this is the term used in typography, or some marketing term coined by the GitHub designers, but this is very cool. A presentation website for this font family looks really sweet! I will give it a go as my new coding font for iTerm and Visual Studio Code.

## [Lost in Translation: Tips for Multilingual Web Accessibility](https://benmyers.dev/blog/multilingual-web-accessibility/)

Accessibility, by itself, is a subject that is hard not to screw up, even on a simple website, without a great understanding of HTML semantics and basic accessibility best practices. Now, add multiple languages into the mix, and the complexity grows by an order of magnitude. Ben Myers, one of my favorite writers about accessibility, published this handy guide about multilingual support.

## [Geist Font](https://vercel.com/font)

Is it some sort of fonts month or anything like that? Vercel also announced a new font. At first the intention was to make one for coding environments, but next to the mono version, the also released sans-serif one. It is an elegant using font. I think I am becoming a fan of fonts websites - they are all so beutiful.

## [Commit Mono](https://commitmono.com)

Do you need another fresh font? Here ya are!

## [things that aren't doing the thing](https://strangestloop.io/essays/things-that-arent-doing-the-thing)

This post is golden! My new favourite resource to read in case I end up in the procrastination loop.

## [HTML web components](https://adactio.com/journal/20618) 

People talk about Web Components quite alot. Thy are efinitely having their moment now, and the cool thing is that this momentum will never stop. It won't because it is not any new fancy framework -: they come and go in no time. Web Components is a part of the standard and it will outlive any JS framework, no matter how impactful it is nowadays. Adopting Web Components requires a mental shift for people coming from JS frameworks though. Jeremy Heith writes about it ad beutiful summarises the current transition in web trends.

## [NodeConf EU 2023](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0CdgOSSGlBYI7_e6Zs4kFSXL9LvOn8gM)

Recordings from one of the most reputable JavaScript related conferences are live. Plenty of good talks to choose from.

## [EuroRust 2023](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH6-VpZ3SvUUKFSEPEWiHQi4JqebBj9Tq)

Being a bit more involved in the Rust ecosystem recently, I canno't skip this recommentation. All recordings from EuroRust 2023 are live. From what I have watched so far, Ashley Williams's talk titled "It's all in the delivery" is so good.

## [An Interactive Guide to CSS Grid](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-grid/)

Josh published another, very interactive guide. It cover rather basics of CSS Grid, without going too deep into more advanced concepts, but it is absolutely the best guide resource to start using CSS Grd. It must have taken aages to prepare such a beutiful and interactive demos.

## [Node.js 20.x runtime now available in AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/node-js-20-x-runtime-now-available-in-aws-lambda/)

Node.js 20 is now an officially supported runtme on AWS Lambda. This is very nice, because I have plenty of serverless functions with a single dependency of node-fetch, which i cas safely remove now as `fetch` is now in global scope. It comes also with some other improvements to performance os URL parsing and crypto module and a few others.

## [The Inter typeface family](https://rsms.me/inter/)

One of my favorite font families ever just got a big update to version 4.0. I am not a typography expert, so I am not going to pretend that I understand these changes. I still can't believe that this font family is made by an independent designer and that it is free. Also, have a look at the new website. It truly is stunning!

## [Biome formatter wins the Prettier challenge](https://biomejs.dev/blog/biome-wins-prettier-challenge)

Biome, the fork of Rome created and abandoned by Facebook, made a pretty exciting thing! A prettier bounty of $20k for a Rust-based formatter that satisfies 95% of the tests goes to the Biome team. This is incredible, and the Prettier team confirmed a winner for the challenge in a ["$20k Bounty was Claimed!"](https://prettier.io/blog/2023/11/27/20k-bounty-was-claimed) It took only two weeks from the first info about the bounty until the release of Biome 1.4. This version of Biome also comes with great stuff and a pretty cool approach to handling binaries via the VSCode extension.
