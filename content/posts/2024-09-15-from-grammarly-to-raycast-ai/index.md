title: "From Grammarly to Raycast AI"

As a non-native English speaker, I find grammar and spell-checking services extremely valuable. Grammarly is the one that I have been using for years. It is a great validator of my writing and provides a lot of helpful suggestions other than misspelled words or incorrect grammar forms. My English has massively improved because of this tool.

For a dictionary on steroids, it is a crazy expensive product, though. The premium subscription costs x a month. The annual price is a much better deal, but it is still a lot of money for what it is and how much value it provides me. Subscriptions quickly accumulate, so I try to cut some services down. Grammarly is going to be one of them.

One thing that I pay money for, and I don’t even consider stopping doing so, is Raycast. I use this tool all the time! It is a great app launcher, window manager, units converter, and translator. Tons of power come with plugins, but you do your due diligence and check it out yourself. As much as I am not a great fan of adding AI features everywhere, my mouse’s software being one killer example, AI implementation with Raycast is solid.

Turns out that with a little bit of prompt tweaking (thanks to my good friend Jordan, who is superb at this stuff) and Raycast AI commands, I can replace Grammarly. On top of that, this solution reduces a bunch of annoying noise from the Grammarly UI. I also save 120 GBP a year.

## Spell checker using Raycast AI

I created two custom Raycast AI commands: “Spell check” and “Spell check with details.” Have a look at the screenshots of how I set them up and review the prompts for both.

> Prompt 1

> Prompt 2

The only difference between them is the bullet point summary of all the changes in the second command. Apparently, ChatGPT 4o is good enough for this use case. I reduced its creativity to none, to avoid potential AI hallucinations and accidental text tweaking. Again, thanks to Jordan, who explained all this to me. I didn’t test it with other models because this works well enough for me to share it with you.

Yes, I am aware of the default spell-checking command that comes predefined in Raycast, but there are a bunch of reasons why it is not working well for me. It is slower and very aggressively changes the phrases or the entire tone of voice of a whole sample. This is not what I want - I want to keep my personality; even if sometimes articulated incorrectly, this is how I would express it in a real-life conversation with you. Rewriting my words with computer-generated phrases totally defeats the purpose of writing in the first place for me.
