[Una Kravets](https://twitter.com/una) wrote down great article that in simple words explains everything that you need to know about CSS counters. I saw number of [impressive examples](https://codepen.io/jakealbaugh/full/zrVdME/) achieved by this feature but never really understood it. Una explained it pretty well and I will take the challenge to create something crazy and completely useless via CSS counters at some point. Thanks Una!

## WordPress 4.5 “Coleman”

[https://wordpress.org/news/2016/04/coleman/](https://wordpress.org/news/2016/04/coleman/)

New version of Wordpress just came out, and as always brought tons on new cool features. I’m the most excited about support for Markdown in visual editor and increased images compression. Be careful that your plugins are compatible with new version of WP before update (I broke one WooCommerce website by updating before compatibility check).

A great article on A list apart about the most confusing concept of OOP in JavaScript. Inheritance and delegation are to different things and this article explains that pretty well.
