Eric Meyer answers popular questions about CSS Gris Module that is coming to our browsers very soon (March 2017). Lots of good insights here. The most controversial question is "Are we ready?".

> Rounded corners aren’t universally supported even now, but I bet you’ve used them.

[https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/12/gpu-animation-doing-it-right/](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/12/gpu-animation-doing-it-right/)

## JavaScript30

[https://javascript30.com/](https://javascript30.com/)

You read a book about JavaScript, you went through all available courses online, you mastered your console logs in your browser but you still haven't build a proper JavaScript project yet. Wes Bos is coming with a course that is perfect for you. It takes 30 days and each day Wes builds a new js experiment. The best teacher is practice, and this is motto of this course. Highly recommended!

[https://24ways.org/2016/front-end-developers-are-information-architects-too/](https://24ways.org/2016/front-end-developers-are-information-architects-too/)

The core of front end development explained in a great write up by Francis Storr. Let's face the reality - nowadays there is more buzz around CSS in JavaScript built with Webpack 2 instead of semantic markup or accessible modal. WRONG! Eye opening article that shows us how we neglected this industry.

## Controlling the Specificity

[http://kizu.ru/en/fun/controlling-the-specificity/](http://kizu.ru/en/fun/controlling-the-specificity/)

Unfortunately specificity is not something that everyone who writes CSS cares about - people should. If you don't even know what specificity is I published a [great explanation](https://pawelgrzybek.com/css-specificity-explained/) the other day. Roman Komarov definitely mastered it and took it to the next level by showing us how to control specificity score by using `:not()` selector. Great in depth article for all CSS maniacs.

[http://jameschambers.co/writing/batch-resize-images-mac-command-line/](http://jameschambers.co/writing/batch-resize-images-mac-command-line/)

You don't have to open image in the Photoshop to resize it. There is a something called "scriptable image processing system" that is available in your command line under `sips` keyword - James Chambers explains really well how to utilize it on daily basis.
