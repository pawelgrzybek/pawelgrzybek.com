## Top picks

### [Introduction to Postgres Indexes](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/intro-to-postgres-indexes/)

Very good read about the database indexes, how they work and what kind of data structure makes them so efficient. This post uses Postgres as an example, but the knowledge here is equally applicable for MySQL users and probably other relational databases.

### [Python: The Documentary | An origin story](https://youtu.be/GfH4QL4VqJ0)

Documentaries by Cult.Repo (formerly Honeypot) are the best, and I have recommended many of them before. This one is a lot longer than their usual stories, but it is incredible to learn about Python as a language, its story, origin, strength of its community, hot dramas about it, and the major language transitions. "Meeting" the language creators and the faces behind the most important parts of the ecosystem gives a good vibe of the language and the culture of the tech. I know nothing about Python, and I’m unable to write a single line of valid Python code, but this was still very well worth watching.

### [Helium](https://helium.computer)

There is a lot going on in the browsers space. [Atlassian bought The Browser Company](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/atlassian-acquires-the-browser-company), [Perplexity released Comet](https://www.perplexity.ai/comet), and not a day goes by without coming across some rumours about OpenAI potentially working on one. There is a lot of AI noise around all these, but there is also Helium. Privacy-oriented, Chromium-based, fast, free and open source. Not something I am switching to, but I like the direction!

### [Hosting a WebSite on a Disposable Vape](https://bogdanthegeek.github.io/blog/projects/vapeserver/)

What an experiment! Some complain about the lack of resources of incredibly powerful boxes that need to handle the load of modern JS-heavy applications. Some put a website on the disposable vape and still have some RAM to play with. I love everything about it!

### [What You Need to Know about Modern CSS (2025 Edition)](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-modern-css-2025-edition/)

Looks like Chris Coyier picked up a new tradition to list the most important CSS features and listing them in a one aggregated blog post. Here is the one from 2025, and there is a bunch of incredible stuff here worth knowing about. We have been waiting for animating to the `auto` value forever, and it has finally landed, CSS `@function`s and `@if` statements are here, the `linear()` easing functions and heaps of other goodies. Check it out.

### [Navigating the World of Web Accessibility with Sara Soueidan](https://youtu.be/ndGKjhzmLXc)

Sara is one of my favourite people on the internet. I have followed her for the last decade or so, and no matter if she is into SVG, CSS or accessibility, the content she creates is second to none. In this interview with Kevin Powell, she shares a ton of insights related to accessibility, the most common issues people make, some insights on the recently added elements to the CSS specification, and of course, some cooking tips.
