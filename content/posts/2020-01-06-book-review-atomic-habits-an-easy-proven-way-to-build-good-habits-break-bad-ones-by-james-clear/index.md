Welcome back in 2020. I have always been reading a ton but this year I am planning to make a subject shift. Less nerdy technical gibberish and more stuff that can help me to be a better version of myself. Let's start 2020 with the ["Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones" by James Clear](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits).

This book is a framework that helps in creating new habits that, repeated over time, can significantly improve the quality of your life. James Clear deeply analyzes four building blocks of every single life routine â€” cue, craving, response and reward. Along the way, he shares entertaining anecdotes of Olympic gold medalists, scientists and world-leading CEOs who achieved their goals by following the rules detailed in this book. "Atomic Habits" is clear, concise and full of real-life practical tips.

This book gave me a different point of view of my day-to-day life. Literally, moments after going through the first few chapters I started questioning my behaviours and catching myself on doing some things that I do for years on autopilot. It helped me to redefined my annual goals to be more process-oriented over being blindly focused on achievement. Overall it is a great read and well worth of a few hours of my weekend sit back.
