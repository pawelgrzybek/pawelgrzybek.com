We spent the last month in Sri Lanka. What a country! Incredibly kind people, the most scenic place I have ever visited, really tasty (spicy) food and every corner is full of shockers. I'm not here to bore you with a review of the places we visited, the foods I tried and the beaches I swam in. I just wanted to share a few photos from our trip and I hope you will like them.

{{< figure src="my-girls.jpg" alt="The shadow of my wife and daughter blowing bubbles. The sky has a beautiful colour of subset." caption="Sony ILCE-7RM3, 50 mm f/1.2, 1/500, 7° 2' 6.872\" N, 79° 51' 37.122\" E. The shadow of two most beautiful ladies on the world, my wife and my daughter. Are your kids also obsessed about blowing bubbles? My kiddo can do if for hours!" >}}

{{< figure src="booze.jpg" alt="Sri Lankan booze store with two queues. One for foreigners and another one for locals. The shop on the picture looks pretty busy with many people waiting in the lines." caption="Sony ILCE-7RM3, 24mm f/1.4, 1/160, 6° 0' 28.27\" N, 80° 15' 7.854\" E. Sri Lankan little corner booze shops have a separate queue for locals and foreigners. The purpose of it is still a mystery to me, so if you know what's going on in this picture, let me know, please." >}}

{{< figure src="fisherman.jpg" alt="A fisherman standing on the rock with heave waves splashing him. Only his shadow is visible. He uses very rudimentary equipment." caption="Sony ILCE-7RM3, 50 mm f/1.2, 1/8000, 6° 0' 1.405\" N, 80° 15' 45.342\" E. This fella was there for hours and he didn't catch a single thing. His patience should be an example for today's generation." >}}

{{< figure src="tuktuk.jpg" alt="A blury picture takes at the night time ride by tuktuk in Sri Lanka. The driver was driving very fast." caption="Sony ILCE-7RM3, 24 mm f/1.4, 1/6, 6° 0' 18.414\" N, 80° 15' 20.184\" E. One of many rides by tuktuk. This is the most convenient way of going from A to B in Sri Lanka." >}}

{{< figure src="nn1.jpg" alt="" caption="Sony ILCE-7RM3, 24 mm f/2.5, 1/2500, 6° 0' 1.405\" N, 80° 15' 45.342\" E. NN1 Dev Club sticker on king coconut. NN1 Dev Club is the meetup I organise for those who don't know." >}}
