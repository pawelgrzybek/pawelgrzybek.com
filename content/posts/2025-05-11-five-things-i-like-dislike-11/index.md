1. [PENTAX 17](https://pentax.eu/products/pentax-17) is a beautiful camera. What makes it special is the fact that it is a film camera released in June 2024. Accordingly to [PetaPixel's review](https://petapixel.com/2024/06/17/pentax-17-review-a-brand-new-film-experience-worth-having/), it is good one. Love it!

1. I spent two decades looking for the deodorant that works, is fragrance-free, delicate on my skin, doesn't damage my clothes and doesn't cost a fortune. [Salt of the Earth - Natural Deodorant Crystal Classic](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B008E4O85C) ticks all these boxes and to top it off, it lasts forever. I ordered mine in October 2024 and I still have more than half of the crystal.

## Disliked

1. Blogs without RSS feeds.
1. When people walking in or out of the sauna keep the door open for longer than needed.
1. Shopify help centre. Recently I opened two cases with their customer service, and on one of them a CS representative sent me to the homepage of the Shopify forum as a solution after a week. On the second one, my case was totally ignored and closed after a week, only to find out that the thing I had been asking for they had put as a paid feature a few weeks before I asked for it.
1. Smoking parents at the park playgrounds. Not only a bad example to dozens of kids around, but super disrespectful to non-smokers. Selfish morons.
1. Spam on Bluesky (I'm not sure if I like Bluesky at all).
