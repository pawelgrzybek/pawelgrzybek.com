I love the "5 things I like right now" series of posts by [Mike Crittenden](https://critter.blog). So, inspired by it, I started sharing some things I like/dislike occasionally. No particular schedule and no limitation about the stuff I write about — I am just having fun sharing some cool shit with you all!

## Liked

1. I recently treated myself to the [Keychrone K3 Pro](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k3-pro-qmk-via-wireless-custom-mechanical-keyboard) mechanical keyboard, and I like it mostly (I am working on a short-form review)
1. As massive game enthusiasts, my girlfriend and I enjoy ["The Last Of Us" TV series](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3581920/) based on the game
1. ["How the Germans Measured Milliseconds MECHANICALLY"](https://youtu.be/Q07CTj4fUeY) by Smarter Every Day on YouTube
1. [Octopus Energy](https://octopus.energy) supplier (if you consider joining, use [my referral link](https://share.octopus.energy/onyx-brook-516) to get £50 each)
1. Literally every single video by [Paul McGowan from PS Audio on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Paulmcgowanpsaudio)

## Disliked

1. On iOS, Bandcamp links open in a browser, not in the native Bandcamp app
1. My new [Calvin Klein socks for £103](https://twitter.com/pawelgrzybek/status/1635203112804945921)
1. The lack of an "un-minimise" keyboard shortcut on macOS — the [potential options to reverse](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/26182/keyboard-shortcut-to-unhide-or-unminimize-a-window-in-os-x/26183#26183) a common minimise action (<kbd>Cmd ⌘ + m</kbd>) look too complicated for me 
1. Sleepless nights
1. Apple Podcast app synchronisation - once a year, I give it a go, and I always come back to Overcast
