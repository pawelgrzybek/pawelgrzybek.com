I was recently inspired by a [JavaScript Jabber podcast](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/) episode ["How to Start a Side Hustle as a Programmer with Mani Vaya"](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/jsj-427-how-to-start-a-side-hustle-as-a-programmer-with-mani-vaya/) so I decided to read an entrepreneurship book. "Business" is not the number one category of books that I would usually go for but despite this, I think that it's good to diverge and embrace a project development from a different perspective. Time after time I have heard about the book ["The Lean Startup" by Eric Reis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10127019-the-lean-startup), so I decided to finally give it a go.

"The Lean Startup" is an easy to read/listen-to publication. It is full of great tips which are applicable for a bedroom programmer who is baking their first side hustle but also for a group of serious-looking professionals, making millions of pounds worth decisions in a boardroom. From the concept of MVP (Minimal Viable Product), through to the quick iteration cycle, A/B testing, "Five Whys Rule" to very high-level considerations about the role of a startup in the market. Although it's written by an entrepreneur with a software development background, the insights from this book are super useful regardless of the industry. I highly recommend this book to not only to people interested in running a new startup but also to everyone who is involved in the process of building a quality product.
