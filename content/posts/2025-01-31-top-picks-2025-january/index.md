## Top picks

### [Collection of insane and fun facts about SQLite](https://avi.im/blag/2024/sqlite-facts/)

Pretty cool list of little-known facts about SQLite. The number of contributors to the project and the ratio of the implementation to test code shocked me the most.

### [Use "translate" to turn off element translation](https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/non-translatable-html-elements/)

Really great tip by Stefan, and also a great reminder that people use auto-translation on the web. It is hilarious but also pretty scary how badly auto-translated content can mess things up.

### [Reckoning: Frontend's Lost Decade | Alex Russell | performance.now() 2024](https://youtu.be/0XwWVjQOmyg)

Very good talk about the current state of the frontend industry. Alex elaborates on the undelivered promises of the Web platform, where we as an industry went wrong and what we can do about it. It contains a bunch of shocking stats, but the one that shocked me the most was the global growth of mobile as a platform and the disproportional stagnation of the web.
