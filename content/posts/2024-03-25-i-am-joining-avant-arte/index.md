Things do happen for a reason. [Losing a job in November last year](/just-like-that-we-are-shutting-down-so-i-am-looking-for-a-new-role/), as frustrating as it was at first, gave me an incredible opportunity to spend really quality time with my newborn daughter. In the meantime, I also learned a ton, published a few solid blog posts, and [organized a meet-up](/i-am-organising-a-meetup-northamptonshire-dev-club/). My unemployment took a while, but I have very exciting news to share.

I am joining [Avant Arte](https://avantarte.com). Initially inspired by rap lyrics and hip-hop album covers blog, it organically grew to the biggest community and marketplace for contemporary art lovers. This place felt like home from my initial chat with the company members. Despite being one of the hardest I have ever done, the multi-stage technical part of the interview felt relaxed and was more like an actual problem-solving session with friends. Meeting Mazdak Sanii, the CEO, exchanging back stories and sharing our beliefs made me feel confident that it is where I want to be.

There are very few things I hate more than job hunting. It is time-consuming and stressful. It was also embarrassing for me in some situations. Stress made me fail the easiest technical challenges. I spent hours doing home assignments for companies whose managers are greedy dicks. I didn't sleep waiting for feedback between the processes. Luckily, I also met incredible, kind, and helpful people along the way! Thank you üèÑüéÆü™¥

I am so happy to share this news! Back to regular schedule building cool shit, writing blog posts and sharing the passion with you all folks!
