## [Your skip links are broken](https://axesslab.com/skip-links/)

[Hampus Sethfors](https://twitter.com/hampelusken) published a really great post about "Skip links" that we all tend to implement on out web projects as an accessibility improvement. Turns out that they don't work well on mobile devices. There is a [temporary solution](https://axesslab.com/skip-links#update-a-better-solution) suggested by [Paul J. Adam](https://twitter.com/pauljadam) but it should be fixed by browser developers eventually.

## [CSS Grid Layout Visual Cheatsheet ](http://grid.malven.co/)

This is my new favorite CSS Grid cheat sheet. Thanks [Chris Malven](https://twitter.com/cmalven/)!

## [Blink LazyLoad](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e8ZbVyUwgIkQMvJma3kKUDg8UUkLRRdANStqKuOIvHg/edit#heading=h.fuqo94v1qejx)

It is amazing to see that Google Chrome team is actively working on native image / frame lazy loading. It will make such a big impact on web performance! I can't wait for some info from other vendors.

## [This.Javascript: State of Mobile](https://youtu.be/6-CVhH4oMbg)

Can't recommend enough to every front-end developer focused on mobile platforms this 90 minutes session about the state of mobile platforms. Platforms discussed are: PWAs (Aditya Punjani), React Native (Parashuram), Ionic (Mike Hartington), Nativescript (Jen Looper) and Cordova (Jesse MacFayden).

## [Babel 7 Released](https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/08/27/7.0.0)
Babel — one of the fundamental tools in JavaScript ecosystem just dropped a seventh version. The detailed overview of breaking changes can be found on [an official website](https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/08/27/7.0.0#major-breaking-changes) but to quickly give you an overview: drop support for old versions of Node (0.10, 0.12, 4, 5), using `@babel` namespace, remove presets and stages packages, rename official `transform`s to `preset`s. The migration process is well detailed on [migration guide](http://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/v7-migration) — thanks to [babel-upgrade](https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/08/27/7.0.0#babel-upgrade) which makes it a breeze. The `babel.config.js.` configuration file adds one more setup option to well-known `.babelrc` file and object in `package.json` file. Selective configuration allows to have a separated setup for client, server and project's tests. The most exciting for me is [TypeScript support](https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/08/27/7.0.0#typescript-support-babel-preset-typescript)! Bleeding edge React developers will benefit from JSX Fragment support (`<>`). Of course Babel has its own song now too - [Hallelujah—In Praise of Babel](https://youtu.be/40abpedBKK8)!
