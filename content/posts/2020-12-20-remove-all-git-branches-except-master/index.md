After working on a project for a while, it's easy to end up with a lot of legacy branches that are not needed anymore. Removing them one by one would be a cumbersome task. Luckily you donâ€™t have to!

```
git branch | grep -v "master" | xargs git branch -D
```

Let me explain each part:

1. `git branch` â€” list all branches
2. `grep -v "master"` â€” remove `master` from the list
3. `xargs git branch -D` â€” execute `git branch -D` against remaining branches

So helpful, isn't it? Catch you next time ðŸ‘‹
