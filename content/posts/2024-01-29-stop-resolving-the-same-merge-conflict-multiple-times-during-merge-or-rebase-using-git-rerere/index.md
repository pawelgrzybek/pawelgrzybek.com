If you read it, you probably experienced a continued queue of resolving the same merge conflict multiple times while merging or rebasing git branches. Wouldn't it be helpful if git could "reuse recorded resolution" for us? The ["rerere" tool](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rerere) does precisely that, and you can enable it using the command below.
```
 git config --global rerere.enabled true
```

```
# .gitconfig

[rerere]
  enabled = true
```
