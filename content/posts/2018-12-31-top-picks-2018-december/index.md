## [Microsoft is building a Chromium-powered web browser that will replace Edge on Windows 10](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-building-chromium-powered-web-browser-windows-10)

Chromium based Anaheim is going to replace Microsoft Edge that will land on a Windows 10 at some point in 2019. This is a big change as the default HTML rendering engine will be replaced with the one that powers the most popular browser on the world Google Chrome. There is no info about the future of Chakra — JavaScript layer used by Microsoft developers. Personally I would like it to be replaced with V8 but I doubt it is going to happen. Cannot wait for the further info about this release.

## [Overreacted](https://overreacted.io/)

After reading ["How Does React Tell a Class from a Function?"](https://overreacted.io/how-does-react-tell-a-class-from-a-function/) by [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) on his new personal blog I decided to read rest of articles. The way how Dan explains complex concepts in simple words is amazing. I highly recommend following his blog to all JavaScript enthusiasts (non only React framework users).

## [WordPress 5.0 “Bebo”](https://wordpress.org/news/2018/12/bebo/)

Built with blocks in mind, big update to the most popular CMS platform arrived. Wordpress drives around 30% of websites nowadays, offers easy to use platform for clients and nice API for developers. Today platform becomes even more powerful. Adding abilities to easily build custom blocks by developers the possibilities are endless. Can't wait for the new ideas that Wordpress community is going to come out with.

## [The Intl.ListFormat API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/12/intl-listformat)

After adding [`RelativeTimeFormat`](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/10/intl-relativetimeformat) to V8's `Intl` prototype, [Mathias Bynens](https://twitter.com/mathias) just introduced [`Intl.ListFormat API`](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/12/intl-listformat) — a simple way to use lists of dynamic data.

## [Things I Don’t Know as of 2018](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/)

Very reputable developer from React core team Dan Abramov, published his confession about the list of thing that he doesn't know. This post is fantastic because lots of junior developers assume that these popular on Twitter developers know everything under the sun. It is very often a reason of burnout or anxiety — not necessary because it is absolutely normal to don;t know about XYZ.

> This doesn’t devalue my knowledge and experience. There’s plenty of things that I can do well. For example, learning technologies when I need them.
