title: "Belkin Soundform Connect enabled Apple AirPlay on my vintage stereo system"
summary: "This little device enables AirPlay on any audio system that can take the source from the optical or 3.5mm jack output. The setup took seconds, the connectivity is equally good as any other AirPlay device I have around the house, the sound quality is excellent to my ears, and the price is very reasonable."

I have an always-growing collection of records. It is my way of repaying my past debts to the musicians I ripped off by illegally downloading albums from the [Soulseek network](https://www.slsknet.org). I have tons of rap, funk, jazz, soul, and recently more techno and garage music. For those interested, I have a [music collection page](/music).

I play and mix my records on a pair of classic [Technics SL-1200MK2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technics_SL-1200) connected to an analogue Rane TTM-56s. The sound is amplified by [the NAD 3020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAD_3020), which drives a pair of Bowers & Wilkins 603 S2. It is neither an expensive setup nor an audiophile one, but it produces sound I enjoy listening to.

In the kitchen, we have a second-generation [Apple HomePod](https://www.apple.com/uk/homepod-2nd-generation/). The background music in the bedroom is played by its little brother [HomePod mini](https://www.apple.com/uk/homepod-mini/). They do sound good enough for what they are, but I would not use them for serious listening. The thing I like the most about them is the convenience of [AirPlay](https://www.apple.com/uk/airplay/). I can play music from my phone, laptop or tablet without messing around with pairing or cables. It just works!

I recently came across [Belkin Soundform Connect](https://www.belkin.com/uk/audio-adapter-with-airplay-2/P-AUZ002.html). This little device enables AirPlay on any audio system that can take the source from the optical or 3.5mm jack output. It is a perfect solution for my vintage stereo system. I ordered one, and I am well impressed. The setup took seconds, the connectivity is equally good as any other AirPlay device I have around the house, the sound quality is excellent to my ears, and the price is very reasonable.

I rarely write review-like posts like this one. I am so chuffed with this addition to my sound system that I decided to share. Peace ✌️
