## [Remixing Shopify](https://remix.run/blog/remixing-shopify)

Big news in React world. One of the most influential frameworks in the ecosystem, Remix, mered the powers with the Shopify team. Both companies heavily invested in React in the past, and they definitely pushed it forward. Even though I have never had a chance to play around with Remix, I admire the core contributors. I am looking forward to the future of Remix.

## [Deno 1.28: Featuring 1.3 Million New Modules](https://deno.com/blog/v1.28)

The latest release of Deno makes npm compatibility stable. It is fantastic news and surely will lower the entry barrier. The secure, by default Deno, will also prevent malicious packages from doing nasty things. Executing unwanted functionality internally in the module cannot be stopped in Node.js, so there is also an advantage of using Deno. I am going to use Deno even more from now on.

## [AWS Lambda adds support for Node.js 18](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/11/aws-lambda-support-node-js-18/)
