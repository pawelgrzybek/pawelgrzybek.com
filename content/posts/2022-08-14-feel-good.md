I have been part of a development team at [Semble](https://www.semble.io) (formerly Heydoc) for over eight months, and it’s been a blast. Working there comes with a great list of benefits, but my favourite perk is two extra “feel good” days.

> These are 2 extra days of paid time off per year to focus on yourself. Whether you use them for self-care, wellbeing activities, learning something new or towards your personal development is totally up to you!

I recently got into a new hobby that helps me balance time in front of a screen and time to relax — woodworking. It looks like I am not an exception because all cool mid-thirty, nerdy geeks are doing it nowadays.

So, instead of booking my “feel good” days to do the regular crap we all do every day, I decided to do something that makes me feel good — “wooden stools and side tables”. I just wanted to share a few pictures of the recently-built things (sanding is boring, but my girlfriend is always happy to help).

Maybe this quick post will inspire you to step away from your keyboard for a moment and learn a skill not related to constantly staring at the computer.

Stay safe, my friend 🪚
