## [border:none 2023](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8ZzmQWppBBsPY2f9_iT0N9lcZG5jAhI9)

All talks from border:none 2023 conference are live. This fabulous, non-profit Web conference came back after a decade. It's cool that the organisers kept the ticket price for the conference precisely the same as it was ten years ago, 10 euros. There were plenty of good talks this year given by the industry purists.

## [Baseline's evolution on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/baseline-evolution-on-mdn/)

MDN docs just got a whole lot better. Now, we can see at first glance that the support for a feature is limited, newely or widely available. Vadim published this explainer that goes in-depth about the details available in the baseline widget. I can't tell you how much harder my life would have been without MDN. Thank you!

## [StyleX](https://stylexjs.com)

Meta open-sourced their styling system framework. It is the tool used to apply CSS on facebook.com, instagram.com, threads.net, whatsapp.com and others. It is made with UI frameworks in mind and is type-safe, scalable, composable, and fast. Its API is surprisingly simple compared to other tools released by Meta.

## [CSS Wrapped: 2023!](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/css-wrapped-2023)

What a year for CSS! WOW!. This post is an incredible resource by Google folks that summarises all the new CSS features added to the browsers in 2023. This year was a tremendous year for this language. My favourite things from this list are: nesting, container queries, `:has()` selector, view transitions, linear-easing functions and scroll-driven animations. It was an incredible year for CSS, and I am ready for another one.

## [Announcing general availability of the AWS SDK for Rust](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/announcing-general-availability-of-the-aws-sdk-for-rust/)

The Rust SDK to interact with 300+ Amazon Web Services is ready for production. Rust's adoptions exploded recently, and this beautiful programming language's number of use cases is astonishing. I have used it for only a few months, but I greatly enjoy the experience and ecosystem.

## [Basline 2023](https://web.dev/blog/baseline2023)

The Baseline info is now also visible on caniuse. How cool! MDN and caniuse are by far the two most frequently used places by front-end developers. Having all Baseline information just there is incredibly handy.

## [Oxlint General Availability](https://oxc-project.github.io/blog/2023-12-12-announcing-oxlint.html)

Oxlint, one of the pieces of an OX JavaScript toolchain written entirely in Rust, announced the general availability of the linter. It is up to 100 times faster than ESLint, which is the current industry standard. I like the fact that the configuration is not needed, and it applies sensible defaults. Maybe doing only `npx oxlint@latest` on a CLI is enough on some of your projects? I am looking forward to the future of this project and the entire toolchain.

## [align-content in block layout](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2023/12/19/align-content-in-block-layout/)

A real one-liner to vertially center content in CSS. Adding a `display: flex/grid` is no longer needed, as per spec. The first implementation landed in Chromum-based browsers. Revolution!

## [Temporal API is Awesome](https://taro.codes/posts/2023-08-23-temporal-api/)

Working with dates in JavaScript takes a lot of work. The number of daily downloads of deprecated MomentJS proves this point (use Luxon instead). Luckily, the Temporal API is getting close to stage 4, and soon, it will be part of a global scope of all JS runtimes (hopefully sooner than later). Taro published this great post that presents just a snippet of Temporal API functionalities and explains the state of the proposal.

## [Making Sense Of “Senseless” JavaScript Features](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/12/making-sense-of-senseless-javascript-features/)

Juan Diego Rodríguez explains the parts that are frustrating for beginners. It is about floating point arithmetic, implicit type coercion, automatic semicolon insertion, bottom values, and others. It is an interesting read for all JS devs, regardless of the seniority level. It helped me shape a good mental model explaining the classic example of `0.1 + 0.2`.

## [HTMHell Advent Calendar 2023](https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/)

It is one of these advent calendars that front-end developers cannot miss.

## [12 Days of Web](https://12daysofweb.dev)
