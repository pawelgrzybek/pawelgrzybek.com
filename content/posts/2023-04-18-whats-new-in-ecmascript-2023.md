After reading [notes from the last TC39 meeting](https://github.com/tc39/notes/tree/main/meetings/2023-03), it looks like the list of new features coming to JavaScript is already known. The final version of the ECMAScript specification is expected to be published at the end of June.

> Last and most important thing is that we are cutting ES2023. We are freezing it, or rather we have frozen it, I should say. We are not expecting any more significant editorial changes. There will be at least a couple very small editorials tweaks that will land but nothing large. 

Let me share the list of all the new features that reached stage 4 and are expected to be included in the upcoming ECMAScript version. Exactly what I did in [2022](/whats-new-in-ecmascript-2022/), [2021](/whats-new-in-ecmascript-2021/), [2020](/whats-new-in-ecmascript-2020/), [2019](/whats-new-in-ecmascript-2019/), [2018](/whats-new-in-ecmascript-2018/), [2017](/whats-new-in-ecmascript-2017/) and [2016](/whats-new-in-ecmascript-2016-es7/).

## Array find from last

[Array find from the last proposal by Wenlu Wang](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-find-from-last) adds `findLast()` and `findLastIndex()` methods on `Array` and `TypedArray` prototype. They do the same thing as `find()` and `findIndex()` but in reverse order. Both methods are handy and let us skip creating temporary duplicates, mutations and confusing index substractions.

```js
const isEven = (number) => number % 2 === 0;
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// from first to the last lookup
console.log(numbers.find(isEven));
// 2
console.log(numbers.findIndex(isEven));
// 1

// from last to the first lookup
console.log(numbers.findLast(isEven));
// 4
console.log(numbers.findLastIndex(isEven));
// 3
```

## Hashbang Grammar

[Hashbang, also known as a shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) is a sequence of characters at the beginning of an executable script that defines the interpreter for the program to be run on. When the Unix kernel's program loader executes a JavaScript program, the host strips the hashbang to generate a valid source before passing it down to the engine. [Hashbang Grammar proposal by Bradley Farias](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-hashbang) standardizes how it is done.

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

console.log('hi ðŸ‘‹');
```

## Symbols as WeakMap keys

In JavaScript, Objects and Symbols are guaranteed to be unique and cannot be re-created, which makes them both great candidates for the `WeakMap` keys. Previous versions or specifications allowed only Objects to be used that way, but luckily [Symbols as WeakMap keys proposal by Daniel Ehrenberg, Richard Button, Robin Ricard, Leo Balter, Rick Waldron and Caridy PatiÃ±o](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-symbols-as-weakmap-keys) adds non-registered Symbols to the list of allowed keys.

```js
const weak = new WeakMap();
const key = Symbol("ref");
weak.set(key, "ECMAScript 2023");

console.log(weak.get(key));
// ECMAScript 2023
```

## Change Array by Copy

The `reverse()`, `sort()` and `splice()` methods on `Array.prototype` mutate the array in place. [Change Array by Copy proposal by Ashley Claymore and Robin Ricard](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-change-array-by-copy) adds equivalents of those methods that return a new copy â€” `toReversed()`, `toSorted()` and `toSpliced()`. This proposal also adds a `with()` method that returns a new array with the element at the given index replaced with the given value to avoid mutations in place using bracket notation.

```js
const original = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const reversed = original.toReversed();

console.log(original);
// [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]

console.log(reversed);
// [ 4, 3, 2, 1 ]
```

```js
const original = [1, 3, 2, 4];
const sorted = original.toSorted();

console.log(original);
// [ 1, 3, 2, 4 ]

console.log(sorted);
// [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
```

```js
const original = [1, 4];
const spliced = original.toSpliced(1, 0, 2, 3);

console.log(original);
// [ 1, 4 ]

console.log(spliced);
// [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
```

```js
const original = [1, 2, 2, 4];
const withThree = original.with(2, 3);

console.log(original);
// [ 1, 2, 2, 4 ]

console.log(withThree);
// [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
```
