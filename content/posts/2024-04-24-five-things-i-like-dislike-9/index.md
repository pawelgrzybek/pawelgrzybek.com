title: "Five things I like/dislike #9"
summary: "I started sharing some things I like/dislike occasionally. No particular schedule and no limitation about the stuff I write about —  I am just having fun sharing some cool shit with you all!"

It’s been a while since I posted a like/dislike kind of post. I accumulated a bunch of things I wanted to share in Apple Reminders. The fact that I accumulated a lot more things that I like than the ones I am not a fan of makes me feel optimistic. Let’s go!
