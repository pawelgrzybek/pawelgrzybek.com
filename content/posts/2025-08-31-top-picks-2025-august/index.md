### ["Creating a scroll-spy with 2 lines of CSS" by Una Kravets](https://una.im/scroll-target-group/)

Creating a scroll spying back in the days required an expensive callback on the window `scroll` event. Then the `IntersectionObserver` landed and things became a lot easier and a lot more efficient. I published an ["The Intersection Observer API explained"](https://pawelgrzybek.com/the-intersection-observer-api-explained/) almost a decade ago, so if you're still spying on the window element, it is a good time to change. Now, we can do even better! The `scroll-target-group` is a pure CSS solution, and this thing literally feels like cheating. The modern web is just awesome!

### ["Curate your own newspaper with RSS" by Molly White](https://www.citationneeded.news/curate-with-rss/)

No way someone can write it better than Molly White. We live surrounded by media algorithmic surveillance, bombarded by ads, and we are being fed with stuff others want us to consume, leaving little choice for us. The only solution for this is good, old RSS. I cannot consume my content in any other way, and I'm surprised this technology doesn't appeal to more folks. Also, while reading this, I was devastated to find out that Feedly, a service that I have been using for many years, made a turn and now does a lot of nasty stuff besides operating a feed reader. My personal choice nowadays is an OML file synced by iCloud across all my devices via Reeder Classic.

### ["Links, Resources, and Humans of Note" by Alex Russell](https://infrequently.org/links/)

Kinda related to RSS, especially if you are new to it and you're looking for resources to follow. Alex accumulated a huge list of great personal and company blogs, good articles about web essentials and browser mechanics. I got inspired and added a few more feeds to my OPML file. This is "the list" if you are into web.

### ["Using the Custom Highlight API" by Chris Coyier](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/using-the-custom-highlight-api/)

Quick and easy to follow intro to the `CustomHighlight` API. Good to know that this API is now supported by all the vendors!

### [Address formats around the world](https://w3c.github.io/i18n-drafts/questions/qa-address-formats.en.html)

Internationalisation is super hard on the web, and address details are one of its aspects. There are so many formats, many nomenclatures that differ from country to country, but sometimes even within the same area, rules differ massively. This article is a list of recommendations to follow when you design an address details form. I found it super interesting how different these rules are, and this made me appreciate the complexity of some of the systems that need to handle all the possible permutations.
