## Project Comet: Designing with Real Data

[https://medium.com/@anirudhs/project-comet-designing-with-real-data-959beccb5c1a#.w64g992vb](https://medium.com/@anirudhs/project-comet-designing-with-real-data-959beccb5c1a#.w64g992vb)

This is really stunning showcase of Comet’s amazing feature that helps to work with real data. No more “Lorem Ipsum…”! As a Sketch user, repeated grid isn’t anything amazing for me, but the feature to use real data from real website is amazing!

## Why Static Website Generators Are The Next Big Thing

[http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/)

I run my blog on one of the most popular static site generators — Jekyll. It’s not the only player in this territory. Number of tools like that is growing up day by day. Why is it worth to pay attention to static site generator, what are the pros, the cons? Well written [Mathias Biilmann](https://twitter.com/biilmann) summary on Smashing Magazine.

New series of videos made by Wes Bos. I’m huge fan of all things that this guy is doing. I bought it immediately after I saw a friendly reminder on my inbox and as I expected, I spent this money well. Can’t recommend resources by Wes enough. It is fantastic opportunity to learn one of the best MVC frameworks. Check it out.

## From Pages to Patterns: An Exercise for Everyone

[http://alistapart.com/article/from-pages-to-patterns-an-exercise-for-everyone](http://alistapart.com/article/from-pages-to-patterns-an-exercise-for-everyone)

Forgot about university level designing skills for a moment and move back to times of playground, when you enjoyed yourself with piece of paper, coloured pencils and scissors. Lego blocks, do you remember? Now combine this fun and basic principles learned ages ago with knowledge of industry and graphic editor skills and look at your designs from different perspective. Think about reusable patterns instead of thinking about entire pages. You first learned how to stick two lego blocks together, then you mastered it to build a castle, yeah?
