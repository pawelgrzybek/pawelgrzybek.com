## Prepack

[https://prepack.io/](https://prepack.io/)

"A tool for making JavaScript code run faster" is the official pitch of a new tool — Prepack. The idea is brilliant — eliminate compilation at run-time and delegate as much optimization logic to compilation. Looking forward to see Prepack out of beta. Really nice explanation of what it does internally and how to use it is [here](https://hackernoon.com/facebooks-prepack-the-next-killer-in-the-javascript-zone-d932556ffd8c). Sebastian McKenzie — one of the authors — explains the concept of faster initialization on [this video](https://youtu.be/xbZzahWakGs) from React Europe 2016.

[http://www.xanthir.com/b4o00](http://www.xanthir.com/b4o00)

Do you remember one of the recent CSS proposal to create basic mixins to CSS via `@apply` keyword? I even published a [short article](https://pawelgrzybek.com/css-mixins-with-apply-rule/) about it the other day. OK — it's been ditched by the author. The only thing what we can do now is to wait for a better solution that hopefully will come at some point.

> There's plenty more space to experiment here, and while it does suck to lose a tool that you might have gotten excited about, @apply really is just quite a bad idea technically. Let's solve these problems correctly.

I head a chance to test Adobe XD on one of the recent project. The thing that I really liked about it was the ease of creating interactive prototypes. It would be cool if we could do it in Sketch! Thanks inVision — it is looking really good.

> Wowowowowow npm@5!

It is a big wow. We were waiting for big update of npm for months. Better performance, offline support out of the box, lockfiles, `--save` keyword as a default `install` command flag, more user friendly log output are just a few big changes in a new manager.
