Exactly eight years ago, I published ["Hello there!"](/hello-there/) on this website. Since then, I have published hundreds of articles. Persistent writing is great for so many reasons and it is the best thing that I have ever done for my personal and professional development.

In this post, I am not planning to brag about the opportunities that I got from blogging (maybe a little bit), but I will try to give you a few reasons to buy your own domain[^1] and start writing. 

[^1]: Although it is not mandatory to buy a domain to start blogging, I am a strong advocate of owning your own content. To achieve this you need to detach from publishing giants like WordPress or Medium. Today, it is easier than ever to do so.

## Your little corner of the Internet

Times are crazy — social media platforms are legal brainwashing machines, folks pay real money for a blue icon next to their name and kids spend more time scrolling through cringy videos than having fun with their friends. Even the word "friends" for some is mainly a tab next to "settings". Knowing that short clips on TikTalk, Instagram and YouTube dominated the way how people consume media, we can assume that the quality of content is also going downhill.

Don't get me wrong, I like to scroll through my [Mastodon feed](https://mastodon.social/@pawelgrzybek) and interact with other like-minded geeks. From time to time I toot[^2] some ephemeral thoughts bouncing in my head. It is just not a good place for something that I want other people to read because publishing it on your personal website is a much better idea. Even if you don't write for others, just for yourself, you will be much better off publishing it on your own platform, on your own rules. 

[^2]: A "toot" was a name for a "post" on Mastodon since the inception up to version 4 of this social network server.

Having one canonical place for your thoughts, research insights or just something that brought joy in your life is the way to go. You can share it with your friends and "friends", thanks to the power of the URL. To top it off, RSS allows you to follow others.

## Writing crystalises your thoughts

Every time I write about something, I do so out of passion. Passion is not enough to write a good article though. A technical (or not) post requires a certain level of understanding of the subject. Unfortunately, having both doesn't guarantee a good article either.

The long process of crystalizing your thoughts and finding the easier way to explain a difficult subject puts you closer to the moment of clicking the "publish" button. Spending more time in this process improves your understanding of the subject, and the more you understand the subject, the easier it gets to explain it.

> Buy that domain name. Carve your space out on the web. Tell your stories, build your community, and talk to your people. It doesn’t have to be big. It doesn’t have to be fancy. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel. It doesn’t need to duplicate any space that already exists on the web — in fact, it shouldn’t. This is your creation. It’s your expression. It should reflect you.
