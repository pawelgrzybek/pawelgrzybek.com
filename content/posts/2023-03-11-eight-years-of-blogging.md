Exactly eight years ago, I published ["Hello there!"](/hello-there/) on this website. Since then, I have published hundreds of articles. Persistent writing is great for so many reasons and it is the best thing that I have ever done for my personal and professional development.

In this post, I am not planning to brag about the opportunities that I got from blogging (maybe a little bit), but I will try to give you a few reasons to buy your own domain[^1] and start writing. 

[^1]: Although it is not mandatory to buy a domain to start blogging, I am a strong advocate of owning your own content. To achieve this you need to detach from publishing giants like WordPress or Medium. Today, it is easier than ever to do so.

## Your little corner of the Internet

Times are crazy — social media platforms are legal brainwashing machines, folks pay real money for a blue icon next to their name and kids spend more time scrolling through cringy videos than having fun with their friends. Even the word "friends" for some is mainly a tab next to "settings". Knowing that short clips on TikTalk, Instagram and YouTube dominated the way how people consume media, we can assume that the quality of content is also going downhill.

Don't get me wrong, I like to scroll through my [Mastodon feed](https://mastodon.social/@pawelgrzybek) and interact with other like-minded geeks. From time to time I toot[^2] some ephemeral thoughts bouncing in my head. It is just not a good place for something that I want other people to read. Even if you don't write for others, just for yourself, you will be much better off publishing it on your own platform, on your own rules. 

[^2]: A "toot" was a name for a "post" on Mastodon since the inception up to version 4 of this social network server.

Having one canonical place for your thoughts, research insights or just something that brought joy in your life is the way to go. You can share it with your friends and "friends", thanks to the power of the URL. To top it off, RSS allows you to follow others without AI nonsense and recommendations (ads) that you don't care about.

## Playground to experiment

There is no better place to experiment with new features than your own website. If you break things up, your readers will let you know about it and most likely give you a solution.

Over the years, this very website allowed me to test out multiple built tools and hosting services. I went through a few strategies for serving images for this website. After playing around with multiple commenting systems, I ended up writing [my own one](/i-built-a-thing-jamstack-commenting-system-using-aws-cdk-api-gateway-lambda-and-dynamodb/). After writing about [the basics of CSS Grid](/lets-get-into-the-basics-of-css-grid-layout-model/) back in 2015, I adopted it before any browser added support for it. CSS Custom Properties is finally getting widespread adoption, but I didn't hesitate to use them on this website since I published ["CSS Custom Properties explained"](/css-custom-properties-explained/) in 2016. A little bit of feature detection here and there and you can go crazy. I published ["Native feature detection with CSS.supports() API"](/native-feature-detection-with-csssupports-api/) all about it back in 2017.

## Writing crystalises your thoughts

Every time I write about something, I do so out of passion. Passion is not enough to write a good article though. A technical (or not) post requires a certain level of understanding of the subject. Unfortunately, having both doesn't guarantee a good article either.

The long process of crystalizing your thoughts and finding the easier way to explain a difficult subject puts you a step closer to clicking the "publish" button. Spending more time in this process improves your understanding of the subject, and the more you understand the subject, the easier it gets to explain it.

## I learned tons of English

Education wasn't my strength when I was a teenager. When I got into programming I started regretting my life choices when it comes to learning languages, so I decided to catch up with my English. For the last decade, I maintain an always-growing note in Apple Notes, titled "Easy English". I come back to it from time to time, delete vocabulary that settled down in my long-term memory and add a bunch of new words.

Native English speakers don't appreciate enough what they got "out of the box". Being able to understand people from around the globe is a life-changing skill. Even better than understanding others is the ability to express your thoughts. Like I said above in the ["Writing crystalises your thoughts" section](#writing-crystalises-your-thoughts), the process of writing is not easy, but it thought me a lot.

I am aware that my English is not perfect, but when I compare my communication skills from today and the day when I published my first post, I am very proud of myself. Also, a bunch of you read what I write, so the pride level goes higher and higher.

## Have fun

Last but not least — blogging is fun! If it wasn't fun, I wouldn't write this crap for y'all for the last eight years, right? Having a little space on the Web where you can do whatever the heck you want is fun. Using it for learning new skills and teaching others is fun. Exchanging links with others is fun!

I recently read ["Bring back personal blogging" by Monique Judge](https://www.theverge.com/23513418/bring-back-personal-blogging) and I love the closing paragraph. Let me leave you with this one, because there is no chance I can come up with a better ending.

> Buy that domain name. Carve your space out on the web. Tell your stories, build your community, and talk to your people. It doesn’t have to be big. It doesn’t have to be fancy. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel. It doesn’t need to duplicate any space that already exists on the web — in fact, it shouldn’t. This is your creation. It’s your expression. It should reflect you.
