Exactly eight years ago, I published ["Hello there!"](/hello-there/) on this website. Since then, I have published hundreds of articles. Some of them are good, and some are shit — that's fine! Persistent publishing for all those years is one of the best things that I have ever done for my personal and professional development.

Having a little corner of the internet just for yourself and practising consistent writing is great for so many reasons. In this post, I won't brag about opportunities I got from blogging, but I will try to convince you to secure a domain[^1] and start writing.

[^1]: Although it is not mandatory to buy a domain to start blogging, I am a strong advocate of owning your own content. To achieve this you need to detach from publishing giants like WordPress or Medium. Today, it is easier than ever to do so.

## "Bring back blogging" and "Just Put Stuff Out There"

Social media are rubbish, and recent events just proved to us how quickly one of the most beloved platforms can go downhill due to the knobhead CEO. Content selected for us by unintelligent artificial intelligence, the unstoppable stream of ads bombarding us with the shit that we don't need and to top it off, privacy concerns and the risk of data leaks.

Don't get me wrong, I like to scroll through my [Mastodon feed](https://mastodon.social/@pawelgrzybek) and interact with like-minded geeks. From time to time I post some ephemeral thoughts bouncing in my head there. It is just not a good place for something that I want to come back to because publishing it on your personal website is a much better idea.

> Buy that domain name. Carve your space out on the web. Tell your stories, build your community, and talk to your people. It doesn’t have to be big. It doesn’t have to be fancy. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel. It doesn’t need to duplicate any space that already exists on the web — in fact, it shouldn’t. This is your creation. It’s your expression. It should reflect you.
