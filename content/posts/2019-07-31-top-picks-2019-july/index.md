## [How do JavaScript’s global variables really work?](https://2ality.com/2019/07/global-scope.html)

Dr. Axel Rauschmayer explains how global variables really work. I learned a ton from this short article despite the fact that I work with JavaScript on daily basis for few years. As always very concise top explanation.

## [Netlify Analytics - Accurate insights without performance impacts](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/07/10/netlify-analytics---accurate-insights-without-performance-impacts/)

There is no chance that I will ever ask my users to download expensive client-side scripts in order to give me some very inaccurate insights about my traffic. My beloved hosting company [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) just announced something that caught my interest though — [Netlify Analytics](https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/). It is privacy-sensitive, with no performance penalty, doesn't require configuration, server-side tool to monitor trends in page-views, visitors, sources and more. All this available for $9 per site per month. Maybe it is not the cheapest solution but definitely the one closest to my requirements. I will be more than happy to openly share some numbers about this website very soon.

## [Announcing AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/announcing-aws-toolkit-for-visual-studio-code/)

AWS toolkit for Visual Studio Code users. Yes please!

## [Algebraic Effects for the Rest of Us](https://overreacted.io/algebraic-effects-for-the-rest-of-us/)

[Dan Abramov](https://mobile.twitter.com/dan_abramov) explains to JavaScript developers concept known from programming languages like [Eff](https://www.eff-lang.org/) and [Koka](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/koka/) — algebraic effects. It is interesting conceptual write up. Don't be tricked by the code examples on this article — this thing doesn't exist and potentially never will.

## [CSS Lists, Markers, And Counters](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/07/css-lists-markers-counters/)

Usually when I come across explainer articles about another CSS property I totally ignore it and assume that I know the subject well enough. Articles by amazing [Rachel Andrew](https://twitter.com/rachelandrew) are different though. I just read all of them and this one is another example of a post that is full of hidden little details that I didn't have a clue about.

## [Everything You Need To Know About CSS Margins](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/07/margins-in-css/)

Did I mention that [Rachel Andrew](https://twitter.com/rachelandrew) is amazing? Another one full of little CSS gems.

## [ES proposal: optional chaining](https://2ality.com/2019/07/optional-chaining.html)

[Optional Chaining proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining) recently hit a stage 3. Most likely this alternative to popular `get`  method from lodash will be a part of a future ECMAScript 2020 specification. This article by [Dr. Axel Rauschmayer](https://twitter.com/rauschma) explains ins and outs.
