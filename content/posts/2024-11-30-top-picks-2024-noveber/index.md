## Top picks

### [1 dataset. 100 visualizations.](https://100.datavizproject.com)

How creative that is! A simple dataset represented in 100 different ways, each of them telling a different story. This is good inspiration for diagram design in your next project. I really like the idea of the project.

### [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)

A year ago, I made a move from Visual Studio Code to [Helix](https://helix-editor.com). It was my first experience with a modal-based text editor, but I quickly became so productive that I never returned to a conventional IDE. I hit a roadblock, though, after a while, and as much as I love Helix and its philosophy, I cannot wait for the plugin system anymore because I need some features now. So I made a move again. Neovim is my new daily driver, and since I was familiar with a modal editor, it took me only a few days to get back to the productivity level I had with Helix. Famously, the configuration of Neovim can be daunting, but luckily one of the core contributors made my life a lot easier and released kickstart.nvim. There is also [a complementary video](https://youtu.be/m8C0Cq9Uv9o) where TJ DeVries goes through the repo.

### [Creator of Node talks Deno 2.0 and the Future of JS](https://youtu.be/2x2eIhn2BJM)

You probably have seen many interviews with Ryan Dahl before, but this conversation is a lot more technical than the rest of the technically light discussions. This one reveals a lot more details that I actually care about.
