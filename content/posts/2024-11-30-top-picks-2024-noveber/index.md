title: "Top picks â€” 2024 November"
summary: "A very short list of resources this month, but still good! Some Neovim magic, great inspirations for dataviz, decent interview with Ryan Dahl the creator of Node.js and Deno, and some good CSS guide for you all. Enjoy!"
---

This is probably the shortest list that I have ever shared with you. I was just
too busy with work-related stuff, some activities around
[NN1 Dev Club #4 meetup](https://nn1.dev/events/4), and my exploration of new
subjects were a bit overshadowed by the fact that I changed a code editor
(again). Neovim that is now, and I truly enjoy the ride. I did not forget about
the music recommendation, though.

## Album of the month

Marc Mac came back with his Visioneers project!
["Def Radio"](https://www.discogs.com/release/32075256-Marc-Mac-presents-Visioneers-Def-Radio)
is a record that has kept on spinning on my Technics turntable nonstop for the
past month. It is full of incredible funky beats, b-boy breaks, and mellow jazzy
sounds. One of those records that can play from the very beginning to the end,
and your head cannot stop nodding. I need to hunt for some previous releases by
Visioneers!

## Top picks

### [1 dataset. 100 visualizations.](https://100.datavizproject.com)

How creative that is! A simple dataset represented in 100 different ways, each
of them telling a different story. This is good inspiration for diagram design
in your next project. I really like the idea of the project.

### [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)

A year ago, I made a move from Visual Studio Code to
[Helix](https://helix-editor.com). It was my first experience with a modal-based
text editor, but I quickly became so productive that I never returned to a
conventional IDE. I hit a roadblock, though, after a while, and as much as I
love Helix and its philosophy, I cannot wait for the plugin system anymore
because I need some features now. So I made a move again. Neovim is my new daily
driver, and since I was familiar with a modal editor, it took me only a few days
to get back to the productivity level I had with Helix. Famously, the
configuration of Neovim can be daunting, but luckily one of the core
contributors made my life a lot easier and released kickstart.nvim. There is
also [a complementary video](https://youtu.be/m8C0Cq9Uv9o) where TJ DeVries goes
through the repo.

### [Creator of Node talks Deno 2.0 and the Future of JS](https://youtu.be/2x2eIhn2BJM)

You probably have seen many interviews with Ryan Dahl before, but this
conversation is a lot more technical than the rest of the technically light
discussions. This one reveals a lot more details that I actually care about.

### [Overflow Clip](https://ishadeed.com/article/overflow-clip/)

Ahmad's deep dives into particular parts of modern CSS are my favourites. I have
never really understood the difference between the `hidden` and `clip` values of
the CSS `overflow` property. This is all I needed! Extending the clipping
margins around the element that contains focusable elements is by far my
favourite example and technique that I am adopting straight away.
