## Album of the month

I'm going to continue my streak of recommending you some great West Coast rap. A couple of weeks after I attended a great Pharcyde gig, I went to see Souls of Mischief live for the first time in my life. No surprise that I listened to their ["93 'til Infinity" album](https://www.discogs.com/release/5651162-Souls-Of-Mischief-93-Til-Infinity-20th-Anniversary-Edition) a lot last month. Tons of great instrumental beats, a bunch of top jazz and funky samples, and of course top lyrics sung by great voices (especially by Tajai). This is how we chill from '93 'til, this is how we chill…

### [CSS Grid Areas](https://ishadeed.com/article/css-grid-area/)

This post is another great one in the series of interactive CSS guides by Ahmad Shadeed. This time, it is about CSS grid areas, which I have rarely used. Using explicit line numbers has always been my preference, but this article may change it, especially after I finally understood how implicitly created grid areas work.
### [Shipping support for module script integrity in Chrome & Safari](https://shopify.engineering/shipping-support-for-module-script-integrity-in-chrome-safari)

A month ago, I didn’t know about the `integrity` attribute. Thanks to ["Script Integrity" by Chris Coyier](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/script-integrity/), I learned the basics. The Shopify team shared great news about adding script integrity to ECMAScript modules. This is helpful, especially for injecting scripts responsible for money operations and other critical functionalities where the security aspect is crucial.

### [12 lessons from 5 years of running a tech meetup](https://davekiss.com/blog/12-lessons-from-5-years-of-running-a-tech-meetup)

I am an organiser of [NN1 Dev Club](https://pawelgrzybek.com/i-am-organising-a-meetup-northamptonshire-dev-club/), a free meetup for software devs from the Northamptonshire (UK) area. Although it is a lot of fun doing something for people and building a local community, it is also a lot of hard work. I found this post by Dave Kiss super insightful and inspired me to improve a bunch about our meetup.

### [Font with Built-In Syntax Highlighting](https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/font-with-built-in-syntax-highlighting/)

Syntax highlighting on the website is complicated. It requires millions of `div`s and `span`s or, as it turns out, a font with built-in syntax highlighting. This idea is a very creative use of open-type features. I am sure this is not the end of the story, and I look forward to future iterations of this idea. Rad!

### [Just use Postgres](https://mccue.dev/pages/8-16-24-just-use-postgres)

It is an excellent post by Ethan McCue about why you should default your database selection to Postgres if you still wonder if the other one fits the purpose better. This post contains references to plenty of other related resources worth checking.

### [Leaving Neovim for Zed](https://stevedylan.dev/posts/leaving-neovim-for-zed)
I enjoy reading deep dives like this. I don't use Zed, nor am I a NeoVim user, but I enjoy exploring other devs' reasoning behind switching working environments.
