### [CSS Grid Areas](https://ishadeed.com/article/css-grid-area/)

This post is another great one in the series of interactive CSS guides by Ahmad Shadeed. This time, it is about CSS grid areas, which I have rarely used. Using explicit line numbers has always been my preference, but this article may change it, especially after I finally understood how implicitly created grid areas work.
### [Shipping support for module script integrity in Chrome & Safari](https://shopify.engineering/shipping-support-for-module-script-integrity-in-chrome-safari)

A month ago, I didn’t know about the `integrity` attribute. Thanks to ["Script Integrity" by Chris Coyier](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/script-integrity/), I learned the basics. The Shopify team shared great news about adding script integrity to ECMAScript modules. This is helpful, especially for injecting scripts responsible for money operations and other critical functionalities where the security aspect is crucial.

### [12 lessons from 5 years of running a tech meetup](https://davekiss.com/blog/12-lessons-from-5-years-of-running-a-tech-meetup)

I am an organiser of [NN1 Dev Club](https://pawelgrzybek.com/i-am-organising-a-meetup-northamptonshire-dev-club/), a free meetup for software devs from the Northamptonshire (UK) area. Although it is a lot of fun doing something for people and building a local community, it is also a lot of hard work. I found this post by Dave Kiss super insightful and inspired me to improve a bunch about our meetup.

### [Font with Built-In Syntax Highlighting](https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/font-with-built-in-syntax-highlighting/)

Syntax highlighting on the website is complicated. It requires millions of `div`s and `span`s or, as it turns out, a font with built-in syntax highlighting. This idea is a very creative use of open-type features. I am sure this is not the end of the story, and I look forward to future iterations of this idea. Rad!

### [Just use Postgres](https://mccue.dev/pages/8-16-24-just-use-postgres)

Great post by Ethan McCue about why you should default your databse selection to Postgres if you are unsure that other one fits the purpose better. This post if packed with references to good resources that are also worth checking.
