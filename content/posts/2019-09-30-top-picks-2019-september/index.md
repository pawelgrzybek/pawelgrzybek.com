## [Pitching Your Writing To Publications](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/08/pitching-writing-publications/)

Recording videos, running personal blog and tweeting helpful stuff are helpful to gain a recognition but writing for reputable services is a next step in leveling up in this industry. [Rachel Andrew](https://twitter.com/rachelandrew) writes down a great article full of advices how to do it right. From submitting a post, writing pitch, outlining article to creating a quick bio. Very helpful article!

## [Command Line Heroes](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes)

I listen to a lot of podcast but very rarely I come across one that I am willing to recommend and share with other people on my website. This one definitely deserves for this recognition. Command Line Heroes by [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/) is podcast about the history of programming languages. Short informative and very interesting.

## [TypeScript vs ReasonML – A Comparison](https://blog.dubenko.dev/typescript-vs-reason/)

[Oleksandr Dubenko](https://twitter.com/dubenko_) published a comparison between my beloved [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/). It was my first exposure to ReasonML and beside the fact that I don't have a time to learn deeply this language now, I found it very interesting to see a side by side comparison.

## [Advice for Technical Writing](https://css-tricks.com/advice-for-technical-writing/)

[Chris Coyier](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier) from [CSS-Tricks](https://twitter.com/css) put together a great list of advices for technical publishers. It is worth to go through this list from time to time. Very helpful resource that deserves for a place in bookmarks list.

## [Caniuse and MDN compatibility data collaboration](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/09/caniuse-and-mdn-compat-data-collaboration/)

Since my early days on exploring the web platform, [Caniuse](https://caniuse.com/) was my place to to find out about particular feature support across predominant browsers. In terms of documentation, [MDN Web Docs (previously known as MDN — the Mozilla Developer Network)](https://developer.mozilla.org) is my favorite place to visit. It is amazing to see that these two services are merging their databases to provide even more accurate and detailed results to web creators. 

## [Announcing the FaunaDB Add-on for Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/09/10/announcing-the-faunadb-add-on-for-netlify/)

[FaunaDB](https://fauna.com) is a low latency serverless cloud database with a native GraphQL interface. [Neflity](https://www.netlify.com) is your best friend when it comes to static website hosting. FaunaDB add-on for Netlify allows these to to communicate so we can start building stateful applications using our beloved JAM stack.

## [Can I email](https://www.caniemail.com)

I use [Can I use](https://caniuse.com) always when I am not sure about browser support for particular feature. Luckily I don't have to build email campaigns anymore, but if I had too, this new service would be my best friend.

## [Head](https://htmlhead.dev)

A free guide to HTML5 `<head>` elements. Amazing resource for all web creators.
