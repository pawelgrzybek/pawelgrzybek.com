Another day, another book review. I recently canâ€™t stop listening to audiobooks and doing little DIY things around the house. So after reading ["The Effective Executive" by Peter F. Drucker](/book-review-the-effective-executive-by-peter-f-drucker/) I decided to pick up another classic equally frequently recommended within productivity-oriented circles, ["The Compound Effect" by Darren Hardy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9420697-the-compound-effect).

The title speaks for itself. This book is about introducing minor changes to your life that, compounded after a while, produce a significant impact. It is also about bad habits or duties that we like to neglect and their long-term effect on our lives. This book is an excellent read for everyone seeking a motivational kick to make a change. It doesnâ€™t matter if your goal is to improve your relationship, financial situation or level of your fitness.

> Whatâ€™s easy to do, is also easy not to do.

The authorâ€™s regime sometimes goes too far to my taste. I donâ€™t want to schedule relationship reviews with my partner weekly or judge people I surround with by their bank account balance. I love the idea of documenting things that I am grateful for every day tho. Some of the habit-forming practices recommended by this book are so good.

Read it, good one ðŸ“•
