After reading a few non-technical books I kinda missed some geeky publications. My friend Kyran recently recommended "Permanent Record" a book about a story that I had heard before from the movie "Snowden". It's been a while since I watched it, so I decided to be a bit more curious about the controversial story of NSA's employee.

["Permanent Record" by Edward Snowden](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46223297-permanent-record) is a highly-readable story of his life, from his early fascination of computers to the big reveal of the US government's mass surveillance system. It's not a very technical book for a tech-savvy dude, but for someone who isn't too technical, this book is very informative. I highly recommend this book not only to people with an interest in computer science but to everyone who is using the World Wide Web on a daily basis. I am afraid that you will never browse the Web in the same way.
