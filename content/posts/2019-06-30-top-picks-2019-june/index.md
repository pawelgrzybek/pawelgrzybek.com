## [WWDC19 - Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/)

Annual Apple event for developers brought lots of great things. My top highlights are: [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/), Apple as an identity provider (login with Apple) and this little section of docs about [changing the default shell on your Mac to zsh](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT208050). I highly encourage all developers interested in this ecosystem to watch at least an opening ceremony.

## [Plugins are coming to Figma](https://www.figma.com/blog/plugins-are-coming-to-figma/)

Sketch plugin ecosystem is an incredible place to find a little code snippets to boost our workflow — similar concept is coming to Figma. Built with technologies that we all know and like (HTML & JavaScript) we can start building plugins for Figma. Let's do it!

## [Firefox: The Evolution Of A Brand](https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/firefox-the-evolution-of-a-brand/)

Firefox has always been a browsers. Great one, fast, reliable. It is time for a change and Firefox becomes a brand. A family brand for multiple security and privacy oriented products: browser, encrypted tool to exchange huge files, password manager and a data breach guard. Announcement of range of new products is a great opportunity to present to the world a new branding.
