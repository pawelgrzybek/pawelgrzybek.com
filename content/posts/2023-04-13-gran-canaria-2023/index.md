When I was a teenager, I fell in love with photography. I started my journey using a cheap [Zenit 12 XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenit_(camera)). It was an OK camera to learn the basics, but I quickly started experimenting with other gear. A few years later, I bought [Nikon FM2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_FM2), and this camera changed my life. I shot hundreds of rolls on it, and to save money, I learned how to develop black and white films by myself (in the windowless toilet). It was fun, but I was too busy with my typical mid-20s activities, and I sold it a couple of years later.

Inspired by my girlfriend, who rarely leaves the house without her beloved [Olympus Trip 35](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_Trip_35), I recently bought myself a film camera. Yes, you guessed it, I bought Nikon FM2! I used it on our last trip to Gran Canaria. No digital sensors, post-production, or filters are involved in this post! Just an old camera produced around 40 years ago, a good time with my better half and tons of fun!
