### [Patterns for Personal Web Sites](http://www.rdrop.com/~half/Creations/Writings/Web.patterns/index.html)

This page is a gem. A collection of patterns for personal websites by Mark L. Irons. The coolest thing about it is that it was last revised in July 2003, over two decades ago. Not a lot has changed since then.

### [Template literal types in TypeScript: parsing during type checking and more](https://2ality.com/2025/01/template-literal-types.html)

Really in-depth deep dive into the TypeScript template literals by Axel Rauschmayer. From explaining the basic concepts to more advanced use cases, followed by examples of this feature used in the wild.

### [Software development topics I've changed my mind on after 10 years in the industry](https://chriskiehl.com/article/thoughts-after-10-years)
