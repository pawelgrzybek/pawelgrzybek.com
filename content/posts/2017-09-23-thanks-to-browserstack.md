Have you ever built a JavaScript library that works great across multiple browsers, platforms and devices? If yes — you know exactly how hard it can be. If no — trust me, this shit can be hard. As a creator and the only maintainer of a popular carousel library [Siema](https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/siema) I have spent a crazy amount of time jumping from one device to another, juggling operating systems and browser versions. Having a tool that automates and simplifies this process would be irreplaceable.

At this point I would love to thank [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com) team for giving me a free access to Automate Pro account to support my open source contribution! It allows me to seamlessly test my local project on hundreds of real devices with ease! Thanks again for your amazing support and for your love to open source! You rock!!!
