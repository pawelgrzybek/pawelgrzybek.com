## [How do JavaScript’s global variables really work?](https://2ality.com/2019/07/global-scope.html)

Dr. Axel Rauschmayer explains how global variables really work. I learned a ton from this short article despite the fact that I work with JavaScript on daily basis for few years. As always very concise top explanation.

## [Netlify Analytics - Accurate insights without performance impacts](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/07/10/netlify-analytics---accurate-insights-without-performance-impacts/)

There is no chance that I will ever ask my users to download expensive client-side scripts in order to provide me some very inaccurate insights about my traffic. My beloved hosting company [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) just announced something that caught my interest though — [Netlify Analytics](https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/). It is privacy-sensitive, with no performance penalty, doesn't require configuration, server-side tool to monitor trends in page-views, visitors, sources and more. All this available for $9 per site per month. Maybe it is not the cheapest solution but definitely the one closest to my requirements. I will be more than happy to openly share some numbers about this website very soon.

It is interesting conceptual write up. Don't be tricked by the code examples on this article — this thing doesn't exist and potentially never will.

## [CSS Lists, Markers, And Counters](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/07/css-lists-markers-counters/)

Usually when I come across explainer articles about another CSS property I totally ignore it and assume that I know the subject well enough. Articles by amazing [Rachel Andrew](https://twitter.com/rachelandrew) are different though. I just read all of them and this one is another example of a post that is full of hidden little details that I didn't have a clue about.

## [Everything You Need To Know About CSS Margins](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/07/margins-in-css/)

Did I mention that [Rachel Andrew](https://twitter.com/rachelandrew) is amazing? Another one full of little CSS gems.

## [ES proposal: optional chaining](https://2ality.com/2019/07/optional-chaining.html)

[Optional Chaining proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining) recently hit a stage 3. Most likely this alternative to popular `get`  method from lodash will be a part of future ECMAScript 2020 specification. This article by [Dr. Axel Rauschmayer](https://twitter.com/rauschma) explains all ins and outs.
