title: "Cross-cutting functionality in React using Higher-Order Components, Render Props and Hooks"
summary: "When working with modern JavaScript frameworks we often have to share the same piece of functionality across multiple components. Let me explain a few patterns that make this a breeze."
---

Working with modern JavaScript frameworks is all about reusable components that contain the markup, styling and business logic — React is fantastic at it and is [gaining more popularity](https://2018.stateofjs.com/front-end-frameworks/react/) every year. Very often though, we have a situation where a few components contain the same functionality and we need a way to abstract it out according to our [DRY (don't repeat yourself)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) principle that we've been developing for years.

Practice is the best teacher so let's say that we have two components: `<Content />` and `<Sidebar />`. Each of them fetches a random Chuck Norris joke from the [ICNDb.com](http://www.icndb.com/) API. Like so…

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

export default class Content extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      joke: "Loading…"
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch("https://api.icndb.com/jokes/random")
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(joke => this.setState({ joke: joke.value.joke }))
      .catch(() => this.setState({ joke: "Error" }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <article>
        <h1>Content</h1>
        <p>{this.state.joke}</p>
      </article>
    );
  }
}
```

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

export default class Sidebar extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      joke: "Loading…"
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch("https://api.icndb.com/jokes/random")
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(joke => this.setState({ joke: joke.value.joke }))
      .catch(() => this.setState({ joke: "Error" }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <aside>
        <h2>Sidebar</h2>
        <p>{this.state.joke}</p>
      </aside>
    );
  }
}
```

Can you spot the duplication of logic? Wouldn't it be nicer to pass a joke as a prop and make the data fetch reusable across the whole project? Maybe even drop it into another app one day? Historically the Mixins system was used to reuse code between components but there are plenty of reasons why [Mixins are considered harmful](https://reactjs.org/blog/2016/07/13/mixins-considered-harmful.html) and we shouldn't rely on this concept anymore. [Higher Order Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) and [Render Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) aren't parts of the React API per se but are advanced patterns that allow us to reuse a component's logic. Announced at React Conf 2018, Hooks help to simplify reusability even further.

## Higher-Order Components

In the world of mathematics and computer science, a [higher-order function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function) is one that takes a function as an argument or returns a function as a result. To translate this into more React-like jargon; it is a function that takes a **component as an argument** and **returns another component** (with some "extra powers"). It is very similar to the [Decorator pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) used extensively in software development. The naming convention adopted in the React ecosystem is to use `with` as a prefix for HOCs because it describes what the "extra power" of the returned component is (ie. `withData`).

Theory aside and let's build a HOC `withJoke` that returns a component with an extra `joke` prop that encapsulates the logic duplicated in both of our components.

```jsx
const withJoke = WrappedComponent =>
  class extends React.Component {
    constructor() {
      super();

      this.state = {
        joke: "Loading…"
      };
    }

    componentDidMount() {
      fetch("https://api.icndb.com/jokes/random")
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(joke => this.setState({ joke: joke.value.joke }))
        .catch(() => this.setState({ joke: "Error" }));
    }

    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent joke={this.state.joke} {...this.props} />;
    }
  };
```

The returned component has a new `joke` prop and receives all the props of its source component via `...props`. In doing so we have created a reusable provider of data fetched from the API. With this we can now revisit our test application and remove the duplicated logic from `<Content />` and `<Sidebar />`, convert both of them to functional components and decorate them using the `withJoke` higher order component.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import withJoke from "./withJoke";

const Content = ({ joke }) => (
  <article>
    <h1>Content</h1>
    <p>{joke}</p>
  </article>
);

export default withJoke(Content);
```

```jsx
import React from "react";
import withJoke from "./withJoke";

const Sidebar = ({ joke }) => (
  <aside>
    <h2>Sidebar</h2>
    <p>{joke}</p>
  </aside>
);

export default withJoke(Sidebar);
```

### Pros of using HOC

HOCs provide a nice pattern to reuse logic. A number of popular projects use this pattern: [React Redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-redux), [Relay](http://facebook.github.io/relay/) or [Radium](https://formidable.com/open-source/radium/) just to name a few. They are easy to compose, use and chain together. [Andrew Clark](https://twitter.com/acdlite) from the React core team, being a strong advocate of this composition, created a popular utility library called [recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose). The active maintenance of it has been discontinued because of the recently announced Hooks that solve the majority of the issues that this library tried to help with (more on that later).

### Cons of using HOC

There is no rose without a thorn. Chained higher order components can lead to prop naming collisions — technically there is nothing incorrect about the implementation but unexpected results are painful to debug. When overused it is hard to guess where a particular prop is coming from and going through a nested tree in the console isn't a pleasant experience. Some rare issues with using them inside a `render()`, class static methods and passing `ref`s are well detailed in the React docs under the [Higher-Order Components — Caveats](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html#caveats) section.

[Michael Jackson](https://twitter.com/mjackson), creator of [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) and a few other popular open source projects pointed out a lot of issues with HOCs in his talk ["Never Write Another HoC"](https://youtu.be/BcVAq3YFiuc) presented at Phoenix ReactJS in September 2017. His solution lead me to another way of providing cross-cutting functionality in React.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I can do anything you&#39;re doing with your HOC using a regular component with a render prop. Come fight me.</p>&mdash; MICHAEL JACKSON (@mjackson) <a href="https://twitter.com/mjackson/status/885910701520207872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Render Props

Render props is another technique of reusing logic in multiple components. Compared to HOCs it requires much less boilerplate code and data flow is much more transparent. The concept is simple — **build your component as you would normally do** and let the `render()` method **invoke a function with the extra logic** as a parameter. Our mission is to build a supplier of data fetched from the [ICNDb.com](http://www.icndb.com/) API, so let's do it.

```jsx
import { Component } from "react";

export default class Joke extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      joke: "Loading…"
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch("https://api.icndb.com/jokes/random")
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(joke => this.setState({ joke: joke.value.joke }))
      .catch(() => this.setState({ joke: "Error" }));
  }

  render() {
    return this.props.render(this.state.joke);
  }
}
```

As you can see, we are invoking a function stored in a `render` prop — this is a good indicator that the **value of the `render` prop should be a function**. The name `render` isn't part of the React API — just a meaningful convention. This is the way to use it…

```jsx
const App = () => (
  <main>
    <Joke render={joke => <Content joke={joke} />} />
    <Joke render={joke => <Sidebar joke={joke} />} />
  </main>
);
```

</p>

Another possible implementation is to use `props.children()` as a function — this is exactly the same concept and the use of either implementation is down to personal preference.

### Pros of using Render props

If you watched ["Never Write Another HoC"](https://youtu.be/BcVAq3YFiuc) by Michael Jackson, you probably understand the number of benefits of using Render Props over HOC. There are plenty of well known libraries that extensively use this pattern: [Downshift](https://github.com/paypal/downshift), [React-Motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion) and [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) to list a few. Have a look at the [Awesome React Render Props](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/awesome-react-render-props) by Jared Palmer for hundreds more. Ooo, wait a second! [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) uses it too.

Compared to imperative HOCs, Render Props provide a clean declarative API that is easy to reason about and compose. There's no need to worry about naming collisions of props, coping methods or out of the blue props attached to a component.

### Cons of using Render props

Render Props used with `React.PureComponent` come with some restrictions but this has been detailed in the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html#be-careful-when-using-render-props-with-reactpurecomponent) and the solution is easy to apply. Overusing Render Props may drive you to somewhere that looks well known from back in the day: Callback Hell — I am not missing these times.

There's not too much that I can criticise this pattern for but there is one more thing that needs to be mentioned when we are talking about reusability in React though.

## Hooks

At React Conf 2018 [Sophie Alpert](https://twitter.com/sophiebits) and [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) announced the [Hooks proposal](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) — possibly the most exciting thing in React-land this year. ["React Today and Tomorrow"](https://youtu.be/V-QO-KO90iQ) followed by ["90% Cleaner React With Hooks" by Ryan Florence](https://youtu.be/wXLf18DsV-I) is compulsory homework for those who are not familiar with Hooks yet.

A clear pattern for logic reusability was one of the main reasons why the React Hooks API has been designed by [Sebastian Markbåge](https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage). [A few built-in hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) to manage state, lifecycle and context opens up opportunities to create more powerful custom hooks. [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) agrees that [custom Hooks are the most appealing part of the Hooks proposal](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889#f7df). This article is not about Hooks per se but about logic reusability — please familiarise yourself with the basics in the ["Introducing Hooks" section of the React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

Back to our `joke` provider. Look how nice this is looking using Hooks.

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

export default function useJoke() {
  const [joke, setJoke] = useState("Loading…");

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://api.icndb.com/jokes/random")
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(joke => setJoke(joke.value.joke))
      .catch(() => setJoke("Error"));
  }, []);
  return joke;
}
```

```jsx
import React from "react";
import useJoke from "./useJoke";

export default () => {
  const joke = useJoke();

  return (
    <article>
      <h1 className="heading">Content</h1>
      <p>{joke}</p>
    </article>
  );
};
```

```jsx
import React from "react";
import useJoke from "./useJoke";

export default () => {
  const joke = useJoke();

  return (
    <aside>
      <h2 className="heading">Sidebar</h2>
      <p>{joke}</p>
    </aside>
  );
};
```

</p>

This is clean, this is reusable, this is easy to read! I am Hook'ed!

### Pros of using HOOKS

No unnecessary nesting, no need to worry about complex patterns, and no need for classes, HOCs or `render` props. Despite the fact that the Hooks API adds 1,5kb to the gzipped React codebase, in the scale of real life projects the minified results shows some impressive bundle size reductions (based on some early tests of some brave community members). It's backwards compatible, well designed, very declarative and a self descriptive API.

### Cons of using HOOKS

:-)

## Wrap up

The Chuck Norris joke application is an oversimplified example but could be similar to the one that you may have tomorrow in your real-life project. The point is to understand reusability in React.

To build fantastic web applications you don't need to know any of these patters but they may help you to take your work to the next level. Every abstraction comes with some cost. Which of these patters you are going to follow is just a question of personal preference. Personally speaking — Hooks is the way to go if I can use it, Render Props if I cannot use Hooks, and HOCs if I have no other choice.
