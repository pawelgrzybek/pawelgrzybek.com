I have been publishing my "top picks" for over nine years, and the format of this series has never changed—just a dry list of links annotated by a paragraph of my thoughts. Inspired by [Web Weekly by Stefan Judis](https://webweekly.email) and [Own Your Web by Matthias Ott](https://buttondown.email/ownyourweb), I decided to bring more life to it. You should subscribe to these two newsletters if you haven't already done so! 

I love Stefan's idea of sharing a song recommended by a reader or [Roma](https://blog.kizu.dev)'s "current drink" that he enjoyed while writing a blog post. The spin I will add to my series combines these two. Album of the Month is a new section with a picture of the album cover from my collection that I enjoyed listening to in the past month. Something like this!

## Album of the month

It was easy to pick ["Like Water for Chocolate" by Common](https://www.discogs.com/master/32409-Common-Like-Water-For-Chocolate) for this month because I was barely listening to anything else. Despite the steep price, I recently picked it up on [Juno Records](https://www.juno.co.uk), and since then, this album has kept on spinning on my turntable.

Classic Soulquarians production. It has a bunch of afro and neo-soul vibes in there, composed mostly by two of my beloved producers (J Dilla and Dj Premier), all produced by Questlove. "Dooinit", "Funk For You", and "The 6th Sense" are my favourite songs from the album, but the whole thing plays incredibly from the beginning up to the outro recited by Common's father.

## ["If View Transitions and Scroll-Driven Animations had a baby" by Bramus van Damme](https://youtu.be/a6ZN9jM-1K4)

In this talk, Bramus looks into the [View Transitions poster-child demo, created by Maxi Ferreira](https://live-transitions.pages.dev/) and inspired by the [work of Ehsan Rahimi](https://dribbble.com/shots/4650389-Music-Playlist-App-Interaction). As a second part of his talk, he adds his spin to the demo by introducing scroll-driven animations to recreate the dragging animation from the original animation. This presentation is a super insightful talk and a great explainer of these powerful modern CSS concepts: View Transitions and scroll-driven animations.

## [Unleash the power of Scroll-Driven Animations](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNYkxOF6rcICM3ttukz9x5LCNOHfWBVnn&si=GmuTUG_I_SDk_KI-)

Bramus (the same bloke from the previous pick) has just released a ten-episode series about scroll-driven animations. The first part covers the basics of the new primitives responsible for scroll-driven animations, and the remaining parst provides practical examples. It is a great resource, and it is well worth your time.

## [The Forensics Of React Server Components (RSCs)](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/05/forensics-react-server-components)

React is on fire (again), and we are confused about the new stuff added to React and how it works (again). Lazar from the Sentry team published this in-depth explanation of React Server Components and how they are implemented and used in Next.js. It explains nuances that most developers don't need to build an app using this framework, but I enjoyed going into the weeds.
