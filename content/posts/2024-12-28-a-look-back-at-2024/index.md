This year I am not next to the Christmas tree surrounded by reindeers and blinking lights, but I am in sunny [Carvoeiro](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carvoeiro_(Lagoa)>) on the south coast of Portugal with my family, relaxing and reflecting on the past year. To keep an annual tradition, I would like to share with you some of the highlights and set some goals for the upcoming year.

A quick goals check from the previous year. I embarrassingly failed my running goal from the past year, but I managed to accomplish the others. I am not sure why I force myself to get into running so much, but I am keeping this goal for the next year. I contributed to a number of open-sourced Rust-based projects, and after a decade of using the same profile picture, I have a new one (maybe it sounds trivial to you, but I just hate being on this side of a camera).

1. ❌ Run the distance of a half-marathon
1. ✅ Get involved in the Rust open-source community
1. ✅ Change a decade-old profile picture

## Fatherhood

I am the proudest father of a 15 months old Antonia and she is the driving force for almost anythign else I do in my life. So far, we expereinced a few stages of parenting and every single one of them, despite its challenges, is the most rewarding thing that could happen to us. Being a father opened another level of my emotional understading inside me. This all probabably sounds super boring to you if you don't have kids, or perfectly obvious if you do. Just wanted to express my gratitude for having so incredible family.

## NN1 Dev Club

When you have a busy life and a little time to spare, throwing more responsibilities at yourself is the worst thing you can do, right? So, at the beginning of the year, I organised a meetup. Being inspired by tech meetups I attended in the past, and additionally motivated by the lack of such a thing in the area I live in, I teamed up with my friend Darren, and [NN1 Dev Club](https://nn1.dev) became a thing.

The NN1 prefix is the postcode for Northampton town centre, a place where I and plenty of other software enthusiasts live. Ever since I moved to this town 13 years ago, I have met only a few local programmers, but I knew they were around, coding in their caves, also seeking a community of likeminded geeks. Organising a meetup was an incredible idea to bring this crowd together.

Everything about this initiative exceeded my expectations! The enthusiasm of the attendees, the turnout, the engagement of the members, and the connections it formed. We have an incredible, thriving community of local techies and tons of ideas for the upcoming year. We put a lot of hard work into it, but it was worth it. Thank you, Northamptonshire geeks!

## Avant Arte

Last year at this time, [my job situation was complicated](/a-look-back-at-2023/#job-situation-fiasco). After losing my job in November 2022, I stayed unemployed for five months. There were very few job openings for companies that I would like to work for. The recruitment process is a lot more difficult when you need to find a job compared to switching jobs. It was stressful, annoying, time-consuming, and momentarily embarrassing. I was rejected a number of times, and I wasted silly time on conversations that led to nothing. Luckily, I met incredible friends along the way. Finally, I ended up with four job offers, and at the beginning of April, I joined [Avant Arte](https://avantarte.com).

Helping artists make a sustainable living is what makes me happy working for this company. I’m part of a small engineering team where everyone shares a wide scope of responsibilities. It allows me to grow as a programmer while keeping a healthy work-life balance, which is more important to me than ever before. I’m grateful to be part of this team.

## Modal editors recovered my joy of coding

Striving for the most optimal solution for a given problem is what brings me joy, and it is a significant part of a programmer's job. Nowadays, AI assistants can partially do it for you (the quality of suggested solutions aside), and most of the programming tools are optimised for the collaboration between you and an AI helper. This trend has led to bloated editors with the AI front and centre. For me, this movement has killed the joy of writing code!

I abandoned all of the modern programming tooling in favour of rudimentary, simple tools. [Helix](https://helix-editor.com) was the first terminal-based modal editor I used, and I loved it. After a while, I switched to [Neovim](https://neovim.io), but I elaborated on the motivation and process in ["The Joy of Learning Helix"](/the-joy-of-learning-helix-and-probably-other-modal-terminal-based-editors/) and ["From Helix to Neovim"](/from-helix-to-neovim/). This change was revolutionary for me because I enjoy writing code again. Maybe it made me slower, and possibly I could accomplish more with modern tooling, but I have tons of fun.

I didn't ditch AI tools from my day-to-day workflow. I still use a few models on a daily basis for things like spell checking, quick searches and help with programming constructs of languages that I don’t know; I just removed their integration from my coding environment.

## Next years focus

- Do fewer things, and exercise patience, slowly disappearing skill, be more present at doin what youre doing. when i listen to a music i want to listen to a music, when i play with my kid i want to play with my kid
- Declutter life, i want more boting but reliably working things in my life, i want mote vitamix food processors, i want less powerbanks
- Continue being present father
- Grow the meetup to something even bigger and better than it bacame to be in 2024
