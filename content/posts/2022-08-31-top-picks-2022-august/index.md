## [Agile & Scrum Don't Work | Allen Holub In The Engineering Room Ep. 9](https://youtu.be/hxXmTnb3mFU)

This chat is a fascinating conversation between two mature software engineers about the “agile” ways of working nowadays and why so many people misinterpret them. I became a fan of Allen after this interview. After listening to this interview, one of the great resources worth checking is Allen’s ["Heuristics for Effective Organizations: A continuously evolving list"](https://holub.com/heuristics/). It may be controversial to business-oriented people, but it is worth sharing with your colleagues.

## [Responsive Faux 3D Content Scroller ✨](https://twitter.com/jh3yy/status/1554310426682281988)

I learned a ton from this short (1 minute) speedy CSS tip by Jhey Tompkins. The `overlay` value for `overflow`, some cool CSS scroll snapping magic, and more. I need more content like this in my life.

## [Astro 1.0](https://astro.build/blog/astro-1/)

Based on the Island Architecture, framework agnostic Astro, SSR-ready page generator just hit stable release 1.0. It is an excellent option for everyone looking for a tool to generate a static website, using the content from wherever you want and with a low learning curve because it works just fine with the tooling you already know and love.

## [How to force push git branches without the --force flag](https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/how-to-force-push-git-branches-without-the-force-flag/)

Stefan’s blog is incredible. He posts many little TIL-like posts about all sorts of programming-related topics. This little post is a perfect example — a quick read that makes a big difference in your day-to-day life.

## [Adam Argyle | Oh Snap! | CSS Day 2022](https://youtu.be/34zcWFLCDIc)

Recently I have been exploring a lot of CSS scroll-snap properties. This thing is much more powerful than I thought. This talk by Adam is a well-organized knowledge about everything you have to know about CSS scroll-snap. It is around 40 minutes of presentation, but it took me about 2 hours to watch because it is so information-dense.

## [Deno 1.25 Release Notes](https://deno.com/blog/v1.25)

A new version of Deno is massive because it has experimental support for npm modules. This feature will open a gigantic gate to people keen to migrate their scripts from Node.js to Deno (like me). The new init command is also a sweet add-on. Aso, the new HTTP server API is shockingly fast. Excellent release overall.

## [Announcing Crawlee: the web scraping and browser automation library](https://blog.apify.com/announcing-crawlee-the-web-scraping-and-browser-automation-library/)

The Crawlee is a new Node.js crawler by the team behind [Apify](https://apify.com). It looks like a super versatile option packed with many useful options like proxies, TS support, helpful CLI and plenty more.

## [Oven](https://oven.sh/)

> Oven, the company behind Bun, has raised $7m in funding led by Kleiner Perkins.

This is amazing to see the rapid growth of a new JavaScript runtime. After a warm welcome from Deno, I didn't expect But to explode so rapidly. Plans for this Zig-based runtime are ambitious: end-to-end integration of the entire JavaScript stack (down to the hardware), integration with frontend and backend frameworks and more. Exciting times.

## [Using :has() as a CSS Parent Selector and much more](https://webkit.org/blog/13096/css-has-pseudo-class/)

In this article, Jen Simmons from Safari & Webkit team explains the power of `:has` pseudo-class. Some of the examples in this article are mind-blowing. Excellent summary.
