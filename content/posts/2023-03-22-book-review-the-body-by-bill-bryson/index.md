I became a fan of Bill Bryson after reading ["A Short History of Nearly Everything"](/book-review-a-short-history-of-nearly-everything-by-bill-bryson/). After embracing all little-known facts about the solar system, galaxy, black holes and many others, I naturally became super curious about other publications by the same author.

["The Body" by Bill Bryson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43582376-the-body) fulfilled my curious nature. In a typical Bill fashion, the book is full of astonishing facts, and the author presents them in a way that is far from boring medical gibberish. This book is a lengthy publication, divided into 23 chapters that individually tackle the most crucial parts of our bodies.

If you are like me and canâ€™t live without knowing how many atoms make up your body, how many GBs of information we can store in a brain or why people have hair, this book is definitely for you!
