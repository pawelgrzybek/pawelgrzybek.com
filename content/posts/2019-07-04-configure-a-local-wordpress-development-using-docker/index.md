title: "Configure a local WordPress development using Docker"
summary: "WordPress being the absolute top of the podium of user-friendly content management systems can be cumbersome to spin up locally. Docker containers are perfect for tasks like this so let me explain."

One of the most popular articles on my website is ["Configure a local WordPress development on macOS from scratch"](https://pawelgrzybek.com/configure-a-local-wordpress-development-on-macos-from-scratch/). I have recently used [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) a lot so I decided to tackle the same subject again but this time using containers.

This is not a Docker tutorial although by following along you learn how helpful this tool can be. I highly encourage you to familiarize yourself with few basic concepts like: [images](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/?term=image), [containers](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/?term=container), [networks](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/) and [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/?term=volume). Having a [Docker app](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed makes a lot of sense too. Regular readers know that [I am a great friend with Homebrew](https://pawelgrzybek.com/homebrew-the-best-friend-of-the-macos-user/). Yes, you can use it to download Docker too.

```
brew cask install docker
```

## Wordpress + MySQL + phpMyAdmin

To comfortably work with WordPress in a bare-bones local environment two components are required, although a third one is nice to have in some circumstances.

1. [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)
2.  [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) database
3. Database GUI like [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) (optional)

[Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) is a tool for creating multi-container Docker applications defined using single `docker-compose.yml` file (`.yml` and `.yaml` extension works just fine). Sounds like a fantastic method to connect our three building blocks together. I will do my best to provide helpful descriptions and comments to each of the core building blocks. Start by making a new directory for your website, create a `docker-compose.yml` in there and let's finally get into the meat of this article.

```
mkdir wp && cd $_ && touch docker-compose.yml
```

```yml
# Version of the Compose file format
# Version 3 is the most current and recommended one
version: "3"

# Top building block that defines
# All containers used for this service
services:

That's it — time to build our stack! Bear in mind that when you run it for a first time it is going to download all necessary stack images. Every subsequent invocation is going to be almost instant.

```
docker-compose up -d 
```

## Voilà!

Hopefully you found this helpful. This simple setup helps me a lot to spin up a new WordPress from scratch in absolutely no time. 

Ps. For simple websites like this one don't use Wordpress. Use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) instead :)
