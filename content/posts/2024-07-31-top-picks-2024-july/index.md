## Top picks

### [Slash pages - A guide to common pages you can add to your website](https://slashpages.net)

Slashpages are top-level static pages that describe the author, the tech behind the page, the intention of a page, current project, favourite software, hardware, etc. I cannot see myself adding 20 new pages to my website because I doubt that I have a lot of exciting things to put on them, but I may partially adopt this new IndieWeb movement. I like the most: `/blogroll`, `/colophon`, `/feeds`, `/slashes`, `/tip` and `/uses`. Robb Knight described them all here.

### [Introducing Writebook](https://world.hey.com/jason/introducing-writebook-e217cae3)

Jason Fried and other folks at Basecamp released a few books I enjoyed reading. They had to re-invite a custom web publishing solution for each of them. After going through this unpleasant experience, they decided to tackle the web publishing problem and released a Writebook. I like the name! I am not a book publisher, but it is a well-thought-out product after looking at the examples. If you are planning to write a book, check this one out.

### [Add node:sqlite module](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/53752)

Modern JavaSccript runtimes come with native support for some databases. Bun has native support for SQLite. Deno comes with KV. Node.js recently rapidly added stuff influenced by other runtimes. There is a discussion about adding SQLite to Node.js! I am super exciting about this initiative!

### [Get The Screen Width & Height Without JavaScript](https://css-tip.com/screen-dimension/)

What you can do with CSS nowadays is pretty cool!

### [Problems solved by OpenType | Roel Nieskens | CSS Day 2024](https://youtu.be/TreBK-EyACQ)

This presentation by Roel Nieskens is a very practical deep-dive into the little-known features of OpenType. I found it super helpful. Also, the whole talk concludes with a quick demo of a tool made by the author, [Wakamai Fondue](https://wakamaifondue.com). It is a handy helper for exploring hidden gems in your .otf files.

### [module: add --experimental-strip-types](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/53725)

Another Node.js-related news that exploded, and I am super excited about it. The experimental types stripping feature has been merged with the Node.js core. Native TypeScript support is coming without extra loaders and confusing tooling. Incredible news, Node.js team!
