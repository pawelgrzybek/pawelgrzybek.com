Paul Irish presented new bunch of dev tools features on this years Chrome Dev Summit.

I ditched Adobe products more than a year ago and [I don't miss it at all](https://pawelgrzybek.com/i-wont-miss-you-adobe/). Affinity Photo is a tool that I replaced Photoshop with. It is not that complex, not that advanced, but interface is extremely similar and it does everything than I need. The only downside of this tool was mac OS compatibility only. Today officially windows users can join the club. Happy days!

[https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/79bd413143afe5ad68104a3c99b9c04f64fc25ac](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/79bd413143afe5ad68104a3c99b9c04f64fc25ac)

CSS Grid is the future of our applications layout. I published a [basic introduction](https://pawelgrzybek.com/lets-get-into-the-basics-of-css-grid-layout-model/) to this subject some time ago. It is enabled by default in new version of Google Chrome Canary. Everything looks like we will get this feature in stable version of the most popular browser with the beginning of a next year. Happy days.
