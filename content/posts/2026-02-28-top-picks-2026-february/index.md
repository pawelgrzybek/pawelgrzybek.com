## Top picks

### ["React's ViewTransition Element" by Chris Coyier](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/reacts-viewtransition-element/)

The upcoming version of React comes with the `ViewTransition` component, doing precisely the same as what you can achieve using `document.startViewTransition()`. Curious ones may wonder what the benefit of doing it the React way is. Chris summarised that in his famously practical manner.

### [What is JPEG XL and do we really need another image format?](https://www.debugbear.com/blog/jpeg-xl-image-format)

When Apple announced Safari support for JPEG XL last year, I was a bit confused, as I didn't really understand the need for a new format. WebP and AVIF are so great, right? This article discusses what this format is good at, and why you are not ready to use it yet. I'm still not sure if the web needs that, though.

### [Building a Computer with CSS - Amit Sheen - CSS Day 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFqtjjpfp6o)

Amit’s CSS experiments are insane, and this one is no different, less visually pleasing than the others, but definitely super interesting. It starts from a simple concept but ends up in a trigonometry maze that I didn't even know CSS widely implemented already.

### ["Your Go tests probably don't need a mocking library" by Redowan Delowar](https://rednafi.com/go/mocking-libraries-bleh/#mocking-a-method-on-a-type)

A good article that explains plenty of Go patterns for well-testable code. Dependency injection, monkey patching, interface segregation and a number of other ways for members faking.

### ["Introduction to PostgreSQL Indexes" by Dalto Curvelano](https://dlt.github.io/blog/posts/introduction-to-postgresql-indexes/)

A very good deep dive into the different types of Postgres indexes. I learned a lot from this article! I didn't have a clue about expression indexes and this article landed on my reading list precisely when I needed it. Well explained from the very basics of index internals up to tree structures with a bunch of real-life scenarios when to use them. I would love to see more articles by Dalto Curvelano.

### ["CSS Minify Tests" by Keith Cirkel](https://www.keithcirkel.co.uk/css-minify-tests/)

Keith is working so hard on the [csskit](https://csskit.rs) and he just released a super useful comparison of all the popular CSS minifiers. It is a collection of 350+ tests of individual features, with a clear description, input and expected result. It is open-sourced and everyone with a good idea for a missing test can contribute to the tool.

### ["Try text scaling support in Chrome Canary" by Josh Tumath](https://www.joshtumath.uk/posts/2026-01-27-try-text-scaling-support-in-chrome-canary/)

Regardless of how the font size of your operating system is configured, your browser simply ignores it. There are some browser overrides, but most affect only the `zoom` of the entire page, not the `font-size` property. The new proposal by Josh Tumath, already implemented in Google Chrome Canary, is going to change that. The `<meta name="text-scale" content="scale" />` will magically make your page respect OS-level font settings. If you have been a good web citizen and you have been using the right units for the right things, you're good and there's not much work to do for you. If you use `px` units for your font-size, it is time to become a good web citizen.

### [Announcing Interop 2026](https://webkit.org/blog/17818/announcing-interop-2026/)

Web Interop is one of the best initiatives that ever happened to the web. A common effort of multiple leading tech giants to make the platform more interoperable across engines. This year's set of features is really exciting. My favourite focuses are CSS Container Queries, Custom Highlights, Navigation API, Scroll Snapping, and Scroll-driven animations. There are a few more that are great, but you should read on to find out more details or track the progress of the implementations in the [Interop 2026 Dashboard](https://wpt.fyi/interop-2026).
