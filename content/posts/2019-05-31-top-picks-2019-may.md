## [Flutter: a Portable UI Framework for Mobile, Web, Embedded, and Desktop](https://developers.googleblog.com/2019/05/Flutter-io19.html)

Google I/O every year brings a lot of exciting news in the software and hardware world. One of the coolest one is Flutter that is no longer a tool to build efficient multi-platform mobile applications but also for Web and desktop platforms. I have a very little experience with this Dart-based framework but I am extremely keen to have a great purpose to get my hands dirty with it. Some time ago React Native would be me my platform of choice to build a mobile app. Things changed — thanks to Flutter.

Like every other Linux distributions, this will live on GitHub ready for open source contributions. The first preview of WSL 2 is due to ship in June 2019.

## [CodeSandbox Raises $2.4M Seed Round led by Kleiner Perkins](https://codesandbox.io/post/CodeSandbox-Raises-2-4M-Seed-Round-led-by-Kleiner-Perkins)

I had a pleasure to meet [Ives van Hoorne](https://twitter.com/compuives) on [typeof conference](https://typeofconf.com/) in March. This young and extremely talented dude built a CodeSandbox because he was bored on Java lectures at uni. Today CodeSandbox raises $2.4M and I am really looking forward to the future of this amazing tool. Every single time I use it, it welcomes me with a bunch of new powerful features. Keep on doing amazing job CodeSandbox team!

## [Google Fonts supports setting font-display](https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/1128548064287952896)

Thanks [Addy](https://twitter.com/addyosmani) for this amazing news! We have been waiting for this feature for ages. No more tricky fonts loading strategies for all Google Fonts users.

## [Hands-on with Portals: seamless navigations on the Web](https://web.dev/hands-on-portals/)

One of the most appealing parts of SPAa (single page applications) are the transitions between the pages. New HTML `portal` tag opens this feature to MPAs (multi page applications). I am surprised how easy it is to implement and use. I cannot wait to see this feature used in the wild.

## [Introducing GitHub Package Registry](https://github.blog/2019-05-10-introducing-github-package-registry/)

Looks like Microsoft is planning to standardize the way how package managers work an keep them closer to the source code of our projects — on GitHub. I am very curious about this idea and cannot wait for more information to be revealed soon. The waitlist for GitHub Package Registry is not open.

## [AWS Lambda adds support for Node.js v10](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/05/aws_lambda_adds_support_for_node_js_v10/)

After release of node version `8.10` in AWS Lambda runtime more than a year ago, it is a good time to update to version `10.x`. For me the biggest feature of Node `10.x` is a new version of `npm` that comes with some powerful features. In node by itself there is a lot new things related with error handling, native add-ons, HTTP protocol improvements and a massive performance boost.
