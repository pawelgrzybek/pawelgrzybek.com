## [What webmasters should know about Google’s “core updates”](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/08/core-updates.html)

Webmaster Central Blog published a great bullet-point list of great SEO practices. Pretty much what I do on my website. Worth to skim through for every single content editor and website owner.

## [How to get experience as a software engineer](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-get-experience-as-a-software-engineer)

[Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/) writes about gaining a new experience as a software engineer. It is not full of advices that will make you a top developer in no time — totally opposite. It contains just a one solid advice that I am not going to spoil to you — you give it a read.

## [WebKit Tracking Prevention Policy](https://webkit.org/tracking-prevention-policy/)

Stateful, covert stateful, navigational, fingerprinting and covert tracking are just few popular methods of spying on a user. New WebKit engine prevents all of them out of the box and this policy document goes in depth about them and explains what it means for a platform. Brave but great step forward Apple.

## [Optional chaining](https://v8.dev/features/optional-chaining)

Optional chaining is coming to JavaScript and it allows us to ditch old hacky solutions to get a value from deeply nested objects. Nice and clean.
