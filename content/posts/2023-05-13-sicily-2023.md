We took the last opportunity for a quick, not "lazy" (lying at the beach, sipping beer and doing nothing) kinda holiday before we became parents. But, unfortunately, Italian prices are daylight robbery, so we ditched the plan of travelling along the coast and went to Sicily instead.

## Palermo and Catania

We flew to Palermo, where we stayed for a few days and explored the city and nearby towns. It's a shocking city, very different from everything I have seen. It's dirty, noisy, chaotic, and stinks like fish, but it's full of life, art, chill and smiling people. The contrast between splendour and extreme poverty is striking. When it comes to driving here ‚Äî no rules whatsoever! Street art fans must visit Palermo because good art awaits you on every corner.

After an intense time in Palermo, we took a train to Catania, where we stayed for a few more days. It is a lot calmer than Palermo but still offers plenty of things to do. The best seafood I have ever eaten was in Catania. You will find plenty here if you are into religious landmarks (I am not). Surrounded by Etna and picturesque towns, Catania is a great location to visit and experience everything Sicily is famous for. However, staying here longer than a few days sounds like a boring plan to me.

## Yes! She said yes! I have a fianc√©e!

The most incredible human being on this planet, my best friend and the most beautiful lady ever seen by humanity, decided to spend the rest of her life with me. I could not be happier. Even though I was stressed, it was the funniest proposal ever.
