Let's keep the tradition going and let me share with you some of the life highlights from the past year. Such a year! In the past "look back" articles I use to make a clear distintion beteen my proffesional and personal life, but I don't like this structure anymore. There is too much overlap. Is programming part of my profession? Not really - I do it because I love it even if I don't get paid for it. Is this website part of my personal life? Not really, because most of the stuff I write about I learned at work.

## Fighting bad habits and le-learning good ones

After dithcing social media almost year and a half ago, I decided to defeat another bad habbit. At the beginnig of a year I stopped drinking alcohol. It wasn't an addiction as such, but just an unexplained joy of drinking too much expensive craft beers in excesive amount. Life events, beginnig of a new year and the desire to change something nicely align at the same time.

It was a life changing ddecisions for my phisical and mental state. I observed a lot of benefits: extended attention span, productivity boost, improved metabolism, a lot better relationship with people who i really care about and no relationship with whom I dont need in my life. Quite good way to to save some dollar as well. I elaborated a bit more about it on ["Book review: The Alcohol Experiment by Annie Grace"](https://pawelgrzybek.com/book-review-the-alcohol-experiment-by-annie-grace/) if you are curious.

Another thing that I managed to defat this year was my panic fear of driving. After over a decade sice I drove a car last time, I took some lessons and re-learnt driving. I actually enjoy doing it quite a lot now and I feel more comfortable doing it than ever before. Maybe it sounds like nothing to you, but it was a biggie for me.

## Blogging

It's been almost 9 years since I published my first article on this website. After 350 articles that I published on thie very website in the lat lmost 9 years, its been tmendous fun! I have more fun doing it than ever. Last year was the most creative, spontanious and pproductive year of writing since I embark on the idea od having this website. I published 58 posts, redesigned some elements, and made bunch of under-the-hood improvements. It's been fun. Even though I canno't tell you precisely how may people read my stuff, because I decided to ditch analytics years ago, I can tell for sure that the number of people exchanging my posts on various channels brings a wide smile on my face.

## Proficiency in Rust

I have some experience writing low-level code in C++, but I never reaolly enjoyed it. JavaScript was always the tool of choce for me to solve a programming problem and this is the technology that pays my mortgage. This year I got inspired by one of my colleagues to pick up some Rust. I am really enjoying learing and writing code in this language. After reading the book, solving tons of Rust challenges I have to admit that I a lot of satisfactio of using Rust. I love the community, language, tooling, and the wide range of opportunities that it gives me. I am nowere near to write Rust professionaly but I am sure in a combination of a skillset that I already have, it can help me in my career. It feels so great to have such a powerful tool in your toolbox.

## In 2024 I will...

Technical articles are easy to write compared to posts like this. Usually it takes no longer than a few hours from the moment I create a new Markdown file until the final piece is published. Looking retrospectively, condensing a year of my life in a well structured post feels a lot more difficult and takes a lot longer.
