## Top picks

### [CSS @property and the New Style](https://ryanmulligan.dev/blog/css-property-new-style/)

This article by Ryan Mulligan is a great explainer of the powerful `@property` at-rule. It is a very practical guide as it presents the power of a feature by using it heavily to build a pretty trendy call-to-action button. I need to admit that the button looks absolutely stunning!
