I've been a Twitter user since June 2009. Twitter is the only social media platform I use, and it has never been a procrastination space for me. Precisely the opposite! It was a place where I exchanged knowledge with other like-minded geeks. I made many friends there, and plenty of promising career opportunities emerged from this platform.

Things changed in the last few days. Elon Musk bought the platform, and things started collapsing. He laid off most of the engineering team and embarrassed himself publicly, trying to explain this decision. He posts tons of shit all the time, which is boring at this point. No surprise that a lot of users started to seek an alternative, and so did I.

Luckily our amazing Indie Web community is already settled on the migration path. It looks like Mastodon is going to be our new home. I am available under [@pawelgrzybek@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@pawelgrzybek), so "hit this like button and subscribe for more content like this". Simply clicking the "Follow" button will do as well. I still need clarification about this whole jazz, servers, IDs, local timeline, federated timeline etc. I will give it a go anyway. I will see you on Mastodon ðŸ‘‹ 

Ps. Social media is rubbish anyway. Personal website and RSS is the way to go ðŸ˜œ
