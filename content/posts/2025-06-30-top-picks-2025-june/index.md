I have been publishing fewer "picks" in my monthly series recently. This is because most of the tech nowadays is boring as hell, and I come across things that interest me a lot less often than years ago. Is it just my impression, or do you feel the same? Luckily, the long years of carefully maintained RSS feeds pay back and serve me as a main source of content I care about. Thank God I don’t need to rely on suggestions served by the social media algorithms and whatever the masses upvote on Hacker News.

As always, I aggregated all the gems for you all in a single place and also came prepared with a solid music proposition.

## Top picks

### ["The Who Cares Era" by Dan Sinker](https://dansinker.com/posts/2025-05-23-who-cares/)

This is a beautifully written piece about the current state of content consumers and creators. About the blindness and often ignorance of the masses satisfied by the mediocre production. A post concludes with a glimpse of hope and a reminder to simply care. Really inspiring read.

### [News from WWDC25: WebKit in Safari 26 beta](https://webkit.org/blog/16993/news-from-wwdc25-web-technology-coming-this-fall-in-safari-26-beta)

Big hardware and software announcements by Apple are nowhere near as exciting to me as they used to be. I’m a big fan of Safari though and I use this browser as my daily driver. The list of improvements it is going to get this year is seriously impressive. Adding support for SVG to Apple’s browser marks the end of one of the most annoying things on the web for me. SVG all the way, and nothing else! Huge CSS features are also dropping, like anchor positioning and scroll-driven animation. Other than that, the list of updates and bug fixes is endless. Very solid release. I really hoped for a dev tools rewrite, as this is the area where Safari is lacking in contrast to competitors, but the only thing we got is an incremental upgrade with features that are not relevant to me.
