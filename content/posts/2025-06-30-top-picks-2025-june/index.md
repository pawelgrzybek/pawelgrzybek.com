I have been publishing fewer "picks" in my monthly series recently. This is because most of the tech nowadays is boring as hell, and I come across things that interest me a lot less often than in the past. Is it just my impression, or do you feel the same? Luckily, the long years of carefully maintained RSS feed pays off and serves me as a main source of content I care about. Thank God I don’t need to rely on suggestions provided by the social media algorithms and whatever the masses upvote on Hacker News. To appreciate the content creators I follow, I recently created a [Blogroll page](/blogroll), and to ease the discoverability of good stuff, I would encourage you to do the same.

As always, I aggregated all the gems for you all in a single place and also came prepared with a solid music proposition.

## Album of the month

For me, every single new release by Little Simz is an instant purchase. I just love her music, and the stuff that this young lady does is just superb! Alongside the recently released "Lotus," I also ordered a few years old EP that was missing in my collection called ["Drop 6"](https://www.discogs.com/release/16234040-Little-Simz-Drop-6). Just five songs, with an absolutely outstanding track to me, "One Life, Might Live." Since I put this one on my turntable, I have been listening to the A-side for the last week, and I didn’t even open "Lotus" just yet.

## Top picks

### ["The Who Cares Era" by Dan Sinker](https://dansinker.com/posts/2025-05-23-who-cares/)

This is a beautifully written piece about the current state of content consumers and creators. About the blindness and often ignorance of the masses satisfied by the mediocre production. A post concludes with a glimpse of hope and a reminder to simply care. Really inspiring read.

### [News from WWDC25: WebKit in Safari 26 beta](https://webkit.org/blog/16993/news-from-wwdc25-web-technology-coming-this-fall-in-safari-26-beta)

Big hardware and software announcements by Apple are nowhere near as exciting to me as they used to be. I’m a big fan of Safari though and I use this browser as my daily driver. The list of improvements it is going to get this year is seriously impressive. Adding support for SVG to Apple’s browser marks the end of one of the most annoying things on the web for me. SVG all the way, and nothing else! Huge CSS features are also dropping, like anchor positioning and scroll-driven animation. Other than that, the list of updates and bug fixes is endless. Very solid release. I really hoped for a dev tools rewrite, as this is the area where Safari is lacking in contrast to competitors, but the only thing we got is an incremental upgrade with features that are not relevant to me.

### ["Partial Keyframes" by Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/partial-keyframes/)

Josh with another good post about little known features of CSS animations. I found it so useful and I see how many animations that I created in the past can be simplified. Top tutorials always.

### ["You're not a front-end developer until you've..." by Nic Chan](https://www.nicchan.me/blog/youre-not-a-front-end-developer-until-youve/)

I like lists and this is a super funny list. "Evangelized the joys of RSS to a non-tech friend" is something I keep on doing all the time! I think I'm a real frontender then, because I proudly ticked most of the boxes. Funny one!

### ["Animating zooming using CSS: transform order is important… sometimes" by Jake Archibald](https://jakearchibald.com/2025/animating-zooming/)

I love Jake's practical explanations of edge-casy CSS/JavaScript gotchas. This one about the precedence of recalculating transform properties is very good. Also, this post presents a pretty neat, simple and elegant way of achieving a zooming effect.

### [How to Think About Time in Programming](https://shanrauf.com/archive/how-to-think-about-time-in-programming)

Time is complicated, not only in programming but in general. Multiple standards of measuring it, and even more to represent it. Take into consideration the precision of solar day calculations back when it was established and mix it with a progressive slowdown of 1.8 ms every century, and you have another dimension of complexity in time calculations. Did you know that the JavaScript `Date.now()` is not accurate and doesn’t represent a precise value that has elapsed since the beginning of 1970? Did you know that not all time zones are location-based, but quite often dictated by the local governments? This article by Shan Rauf will help you clarify all of these. A very good (and lengthy) read.
