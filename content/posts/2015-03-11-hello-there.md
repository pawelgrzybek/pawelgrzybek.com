I’m so happy to introduce you my new website. It’s not about the fancy cool effects, it is not about shiny design. It’s purely about the content that I would like to share with you.

After a few months of creating a weekly newsletters for web developers in [company where I currently work](http://www.creare.co.uk/) I found out that I enjoy sharing knowledge and be more involved info community of web developers. That was my biggest kick to choose a blogging platform, start writing a content and publish my thoughts.

## Technically about this website

This is a static website generated by amazing tool called [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It is my first project build on this tool but I love it already. It doesn’t surprise me why it is so popular in geek crowd. You need to create a few template files, create posts files in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format and type one command in your Terminal. Easy like that! Something that makes it even more fantastic is ability to host your website on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) absolutely for free.

Few SASS files are compiled to one minified CSS Stylesheet via compiler build into Jekyll core. [Fira Sans Font by Erik Spiekermann](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Fira+Sans) comes from Google Fonts.

If you are curious about files structure of source files you can always have a look at [Github repository](https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/pawelgrzybek.github.io). If you have any further question  feel free to use Disqus that I implemented as my comments platform. Use RSS Feed to stay tuned about new posts.
