I donâ€™t want to joke about the JavaScript ecosystem and its dependencies because we have seen enough of it. Letâ€™s accept that our projects consist of hundreds of third-party modules â€” when it works, it works fine and pays the bills.

Sometimes we need to get some insights about the packages that we use. For example, whatâ€™s the licence of the software we rely on? What is the version of the particular package? How many modules we depend on are created by [Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com), and how is that even possible? Manually going through `node_modules` sounds like a chore, but luckily there is a better way.

The [`npm query` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-query) added to [v8.16.0](https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v8.16.0) accepts a [CSS-like dependency selector](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/dependency-selectors#dependency-selector-syntax-v100) and returns a filtered JSON list of dependencies from your project. Letâ€™s look at a few practical examples that can help us in our day-to-day job.

## Basic npm queries

```bash
# List all dependencies
npm query "*"
```

```bash
# List all dependencies with "react" in their name
npm query "[name*=react]"
```

```bash
# List all dependencies with a licence other than MIT
npm query ":not([license=MIT])"
```

```bash
# List all dependencies without dependencies
npm query ":empty"
```

```bash
# List all dependencies that seek funding
npm query ":has([funding])"
```

```bash
# List all packages created by Sindre Sorhus ðŸ¦„
npm query ":attr(author, [name=\"Sindre Sorhus\"])"
```

## Advanced npm queries

The result of the npm query command is unformatted JSON which is OK, but with tools like the [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) we can achieve a lot more! Have a look at a few more advanced examples.


```bash
# List all dependencies (formatted output)
npm query "*" | jq '.'
```

```bash
# List only names of packages created by Sindre Sorhus ðŸ¦„
npm query ":attr(author, [name=\"Sindre Sorhus\"])" | jq '.[] | .name'
```


```bash
# Uninstall all packages with "gulp" in their name
npm query "[name*=gulp]" | jq 'map(.name)|join("\n")' -r | xargs -I {} npm uninstall {}
```
