### [Make creative borders with background-clip border-area](https://webkit.org/blog/16214/background-clip-border-area/)

A great post about totally not supported feature at the moment of writing this
post. It opens so many great possibilities, especially for fancy looking buttons
that clearly was a trend of recent years. This one can save a lot of hassel with
creating an addition elements just for masking reasons.

## [React v19](https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19)

This is the long-anticipated release of the new version of React, which comes
with a bunch of incredible new features. Support for actions, server components,
simplified reference passing, better hydration warning messages, support for
document metadata, stylesheets and scripts. There is also support for web
components. This is a juicy release!
