### [Make creative borders with background-clip border-area](https://webkit.org/blog/16214/background-clip-border-area/)

A great post about totally not supported feature at the moment of writing this
post. It opens so many great possibilities, especially for fancy looking buttons
that clearly was a trend of recent years. This one can save a lot of hassel with
creating an addition elements just for masking reasons.

## [React v19](https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19)

This is the long-anticipated release of the new version of React, which comes
with a bunch of incredible new features. Support for actions, server components,
simplified reference passing, better hydration warning messages, support for
document metadata, stylesheets and scripts. There is also support for web
components. This is a juicy release!

## [Storing times for human events](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/27/storing-times-for-human-events/)

A great article by Somin Willison about the best format for storing the date and
time of real-life events. As an organiser of the [NN1 Dev Club](https://nn1.dev)
meetup, this subject is close to my heart, and I spent not a trivial amount of
time thinking about this problem. Storing date and time is only the first part
of the puzzle, but the consumers of this value are what bring the complexity. I
cannot tell you how much I dislike everything about calendar invites compatible
with multiple popular providers. I spent too much time on this one!

## [CSSWG Minutes Telecon (2024-12-04): Just Use Grid vs. Display: Masonry](https://css-tricks.com/csswg-minutes-telecon-2024-12-04-just-use-grid-vs-display-masonry/)

There are two competing specifications to add native CSS masonry layout: one
coming from Apple and another from Google developers. This post is a nice
summary of recent CSSWG meetings about it and the consensus that comes out of
them (or rather the lack of it).
