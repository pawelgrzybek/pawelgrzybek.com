You have just landed on the 100th edition of my monthly top picks. I started this series in [March 2015](/top-picks-2015-march/), and without a single break, I have been sharing good stuff with you every month. I'm not sure how many regular readers of this series I have, but I am very grateful to each and every one of you. If you like what I do, [buy me a cup of good americano](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/pawelgrzybek) to say thank you. Without further ado, let's get to the best resources I found in June 2023.

## [Stop Rewriting Your CSS! Use :not() Instead](https://youtu.be/WnUNMcy-YTs)

Zoran Jambor, the guy behind CSS Weekly, shared a great list of use cases for the CSS `:not()` pseudo-class. It all originated from a tweet where he asked about people's favorite use cases, and it ended up as a well-put-together video.

## [News from WWDC23: WebKit Features in Safari 17 beta](https://webkit.org/blog/14205/news-from-wwdc23-webkit-features-in-safari-17-beta/)

I streongly disagree with the "Safari is a the new IE" repeated ofver and over again. Safari is the fastest developing browser in the recent years, and the feat of features announced at the WWDC23 is a proof of that. Desktop web apps, Spatial Web (whatever that even means), the `model` elemtns for 3D models, new image formats (JPEG XL and HEIC), the `popover` attribute and a lont more.

## [Hands on with the Node.js test runner](https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/node-js-test-runner/)

This article by Phil Nash is a great resource if you have an itch to replace your current test runner with a built-in Node.js one. The set of exmaples covers the basics, mentions a more advanced use casea and also touches on the future of the Node.js test runner.

## [Web technology sessions at WWDC23](https://www.webkit.org/blog/14203/web-technology-sessions-at-wwdc23/)

We are post-WWDC23, Apple's annual developer conference. The WebKit team crafted a list of sessions for web developers. I'm very excited about some of the changes coming to Safari this year—an absolutely silly amount of bleeding-edge CSS features, new media formats, redesigned Web Inspector, and more. Additionally, understanding how to prepare your web projects for the new special computing on VisionOS is a must.

## [CSS Day 2023 — YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjnstNlepBvOG299LOrvMFJ8WreCDWWd4)

Unfortunately, I didn't have the chance to fly to Amsterdam for CSS Day 2023, but I followed along on YouTube. There were so many great talks this year. I am really excited about how great CSS is becoming. Several presenters mentioned that we don't have enough CSS-oriented events, and I agree. I hope to see more of them in the future, but if not, I'll see you all at CSS Day 2024. There's no chance I'm missing it next year.

## [Cyclic Dependency Space Toggles](https://kizu.dev/cyclic-toggles/)

This is the most mind-bending CSS technique that I have heard of in a while. Deliberate cyclic dependencies to force invalidity and obscure techniques to fall back to nothing. My mind literally exploded when I read this article.

## [Config 2023 Product Launch Keynote](https://youtu.be/yI9QVwkk2Go)

Right off the bat, I can tell that Figma Config Conf is like any Apple conference before COVID (Apple conferences post-pandemic are pre-recorded). Same vibe, same kind of announcement style, just a little bit more laid back. I like it. But let's not talk about the conference style, let's talk about the content. Wow! Figma is no longer a simple tool to design static visuals—it is a full-blown architecture to design, prototype, and collaborate with product owners and developers. Variables, Dev mode, improvements to auto layout, dark mode support, size constraints, and more. I'm very excited!

## [The gotchas of CSS Nesting](https://kilianvalkhof.com/2023/css-html/the-gotchas-of-css-nesting/)

CSS Nesting is available in most modern browsers (we are waiting only for Firefox to catch up) and it is enough of a reason for many to move away from preprocessors to vanilla CSS. It behaves a little bit differently than you may expect, so it's worth reading this article by Kilian Valkhof to understand the gotchas.
