## [Dark Visitors](https://darkvisitors.com)

The list of potential AI robots that can potentially scrape content from your website is a lot longer than you expect. This resource is a comprehensive list of the known ones with a helpful guide on limiting their access to your website. If you care, your robots.txt file can suddenly grow from a classic 3-liner to a lengthy rules set. Messy as hell!

This resource is an exciting collection of JavaScript projects that have gained popularity in the past year—nicely categorized by the stack, framework, tooling, platform, and testing categories. Very well done, Michael Rambeau.

I also published ["TypeScript interface vs. type"](https://pawelgrzybek.com/typescript-interface-vs-type/) a few years back. This take by Nathan Shively-Sanders, one of the TS maintainers, is a good explanation of why we even have two similar features in the language in the first place.
