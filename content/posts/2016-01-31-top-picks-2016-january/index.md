Axel Rauschmayer as a strong contributor to ES2015 (or more popular as a ES6) just released a book called “Setting up ES6”. It covers all that you need to know to get you running in world of modern js applications. Content is ready to read for free online, but you can spend six bucks for tablet or kindle version. You better give it a read because ES2016 is coming.
