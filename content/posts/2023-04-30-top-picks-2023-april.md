## [Rust Trademark Policy Comment Form](https://twitter.com/rust_foundation/status/1644132378858729474)

In August last year, the Rust Foundation stated a desire to take action to enforce a set of rules around the trademark policy. In principle, it is a good thing, but the execution was a reason for well-articulated complaints. Please give it a read and submit your feedback. We, as a community, can help protect the trademark and still freely contribute to the Rust ecosystem without fear of violating the rules.
