## Top picks

### ["Open Social" by Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/open-social/)

This is a great and not too technical explainer of the ATProto and how it enables an open social. Dan is really great at explaining complex subjects using simple analogies, and this one is no different. I would love to read a post like this one about the Fediverse, which I use a lot more than anything related to ATProto (pretty much Bluesky only). A few days later, Dan also posted ["Where It's at://"](https://overreacted.io/where-its-at/) which is a lot more technica deep dive into the output JSON resolutions from the `at://` links.

### [CSS-only floating focus with anchor positioning](https://polypane.app/blog/css-only-floating-focus-with-anchor-positioning/)

Kilian, the creator of Polypane, recreated one of the debugging tools from his browser using pure CSS. Pretty nice way of removing a ton of expensive calculations from the main thread. Another good example that shows that CSS anchor positioning is not for tooltips only.
