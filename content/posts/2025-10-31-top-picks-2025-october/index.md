## Top picks

### ["Open Social" by Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/open-social/)

This is a great and not too technical explainer of the ATProto and how it enables an open social. Dan is really great at explaining complex subjects using simple analogies, and this one is no different. I would love to read a post like this one about the Fediverse, which I use a lot more than anything related to ATProto (pretty much Bluesky only). A few days later, Dan also posted ["Where It's at://"](https://overreacted.io/where-its-at/) which is a lot more technica deep dive into the output JSON resolutions from the `at://` links.

### [CSS-only floating focus with anchor positioning](https://polypane.app/blog/css-only-floating-focus-with-anchor-positioning/)

Kilian, the creator of Polypane, recreated one of the debugging tools from his browser using pure CSS. Pretty nice way of removing a ton of expensive calculations from the main thread. Another good example that shows that CSS anchor positioning is not for tooltips only.

### [React Compiler v1.0](https://react.dev/blog/2025/10/07/react-compiler-1)

My least favourite part of writing React components is soon going to be a thing of the past. The final release of React stable means that we no longer need to care about memoisation of static values and functions. This is what the compiler is going to do for us. This is going to significantly simplify the way we write React components.

### [15 Recent Node.js Features that Replace Popular npm Packages](https://nodesource.com/blog/nodejs-features-replacing-npm-packages)

Modern JavaScript runtimes are packed with features that in the past required some external packages. Here is a good list of built-in commands like that. I published articles about some of them in the past, but I also learned a ton from this article. Great summary.

### [MiniMax - Neovim with maximum MINI](https://nvim-mini.org/blog/2025-10-13-announce-minimax.html)

This is a pretty niche one, for Neovim fans only. Evgeni Chasnovski, the creator of the mini.nvim family, released a great resource to help you out with your Neovim configuration. It is not another opinionated distribution, but more like a starting point to build upon. The closest thing I would compare it to is [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), which I like a ton, and this was my starting point for my configuration. Evgeni put tons of love into it, and the comments on the Lua files are insanely helpful. I’m a huge fan of his contributions to the Neovim ecosystem.

## [A pragmatic guide to modern CSS colours - part one](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-pragmatic-guide-to-modern-css-colours-part-one/)

This title doesn't lie, this guide is very pragmatic. Potentially you know about many of these new colour features, but I'm sure you will learn an extra thing or two. I totally missed the fact that so many colour formats do not require commas and units anymore. This is a little thing, but when typed hundreds of times, it is also a time saver. Kevin is on fire with his content creation game!
