### ["Open Social" by Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/open-social/)

This is a great and not too technical explainer of the ATProto and how it enables an open social. Dan is really great at explaining complex subjects using simple analogies, and this one is no different. I would love to read a post like this one about the Fediverse, which I use a lot more than anything related to ATProto (pretty much Bluesky only). A few days later, Dan also posted ["Where It's at://"](https://overreacted.io/where-its-at/) which is a lot more technica deep dive into the output JSON resolutions from the `at://` links.

### [CSS-only floating focus with anchor positioning](https://polypane.app/blog/css-only-floating-focus-with-anchor-positioning/)

### [React Compiler v1.0](https://react.dev/blog/2025/10/07/react-compiler-1)

My least favourite part of writing React components is soon going to be a thing of the past. The final release of React stable means that we no longer need to care about memoisation of static values and functions. This is what the compiler is going to do for us. This is going to significantly simplify the way we write React components.
