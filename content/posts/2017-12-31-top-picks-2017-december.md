## Parcel

Webpack is amazing but the only downside of it is overwhelming configuration. Parcel comes handy then. This is a new kid on the block — no configuration is required and somehow it resolves all dependencies for you in no time. Fingers crossed for future of this project.

## Turbo

NPM client five time faster than it's origin, smaller node_modules size and most interestingly works in the browser — Turbo. Another brand new tool that the dev community on Twitter went crazy about. Instant dependency resolution, robust caching mechanisms and works great with tiny and massive apps. Sounds nice. Time will show us if it is going to take over the popularity of good old npm and yarn.

Google changes indexing mechanism from desktop-first to mobile-first. We should expect a strong indexing bump for all websites that are mobile optimized and probably a significant drop for old-school, not maintained projects.

Worth to keep an eye on future of this one.

> We want to make JS a universal language for coding everything, everywhere. JS is present in every web browser; it’s more and more present in server side with NodeJS, and it is also used for IOT with Espruino. However, each platform has its own specifications. With NectarJS, we want to unify all of these in one solution.
