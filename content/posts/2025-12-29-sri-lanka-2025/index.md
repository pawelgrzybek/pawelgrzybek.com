title: "Sri Lanka 2025"
summary: "A little photo review from our honeymoon trip to Sri Lanka. Absolutely the most exotic and beautiful country I have ever visited!"
---

We spent most of the month in Sri Lanka. It is becoming our annual tradition to travel abroad for the Christmas season. What a country, I’m telling you!

People in Sri Lanka are incredibly kind. No matter whether they are wealthy or living in extreme poverty, no matter which god they pray to, south or north, Sri Lankan people are the loveliest. Crazy tuk-tuk drivers though! Do not ask them for non-alcoholic beer unless you want to trigger big laughs 🍻

If you’re hunting for scenic views, a month here is not enough. This is by far the most beautiful country I have ever visited and for sure we will revisit it when our daughter is a tad older. Beautiful seasides, mountains, fields, temples and absolutely wild nature. Monkeys and two-metre-long iguanas in your garden are the norm, and you'd better accept the fact that you're going to share your hotel room with house geckos. Strange at first but these little fellas are cute 🦎

What is a holiday without trying new food? There is a lot to enjoy here. My favourite coconut roti, lentil dhal, spicy coconut sambal, devilled calamari, red bananas, passion fruits, and absolutely the best mangoes nature can produce. Restaurant owners are always very welcoming, and they wholeheartedly want you to try dishes they are proud of. Seafood here is incredible and so cheap compared to Europe. Overall, a great destination for foodies.

A few pics to make you all jealous 🇱🇰

My kiddo can do it for hours!" caption="Sony ILCE-7RM3, 50 mm f/1.2, 1/500, 7° 2' 6.872\" N, 79° 51' 37.122\" E. The shadow of the two most beautiful ladies in the world, my wife and my daughter. Are your kids also obsessed with blowing bubbles? My kiddo can do it for hours!" >}}

{{< figure src="booze.jpg" alt="Sri Lankan booze store with two queues. One for foreigners and another one for locals. The shop on the picture looks pretty busy with many people waiting in the lines." caption="Sony ILCE-7RM3, 24mm f/1.4, 1/160, 6° 0' 28.27\" N, 80° 15' 7.854\" E. Sri Lankan little corner booze shops have a separate queue for locals and foreigners. The purpose of it is still a mystery to me, so if you know what is going on in this picture, let me know, please." >}}

{{< figure size="biggie" src="fisherman.jpg" alt="A fisherman standing on the rock with heave waves splashing him. Only his shadow is visible. He uses very rudimentary equipment." caption="Sony ILCE-7RM3, 50 mm f/1.2, 1/8000, 6° 0' 1.405\" N, 80° 15' 45.342\" E. This fella was there for hours and he didn't catch a single thing. His patience should be an example for today's generation." >}}

{{< figure src="tuktuk.jpg" alt="A blury picture takes at the night time ride by tuktuk in Sri Lanka. The driver was driving very fast." caption="Sony ILCE-7RM3, 24 mm f/5.6, 1/10, 6° 0' 3.616\" N, 80° 15' 43.302\" E. One of the many rides by tuktuk. This is the most convenient way of going from A to B in Sri Lanka." >}}

{{< figure size="biggie" src="patience.jpg" alt="Lady showing the beautifully hand crafted thing.

It is hard to describe how mesmerizing the process of looking at this lady doing this thing was. She has been doing it for the last 25 years, every day. Meeting this lady was a good lesson in patience for me. One of the most beautiful things I have ever seen in my life, not only the final product but this kind lady doing it." >}}

We found a secret beach (not so secret anymore as I'm revealing its longitude and latitude) and we enjoyed it all just for ourselves for a whole day. Probably the most beautiful places that I have seen in my whole life." >}}

Full credit for this composition goes to my wife who stuck out her hand out of the hotel window and snapped a way better picture than mine in no time. I followed with five thousand attempts to get anything similar to her photo and that's the best one I got." >}}
