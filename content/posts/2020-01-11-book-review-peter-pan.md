Yes, ["Peter Pan"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34268.Peter_Pan), a kids book. It’s not me being childish, it’s you being boring — sorry for being brutally honest. After the last decade that I’ve spent reading serious, mature, programming and science-related books, I decided to re-experience that feeling of pure adventure and make-believe which comes from reading a children’s book. I don't regret this decision and I am sure I am going to read more toddler novels soon.

Peter Pan took me to a higher level of fantasy and imagination more than any other story that I have read or listened to in last few years. It’s a world of speaking trees, grumpy fairies, flying boys who never want to grow up — everything that I need. Despite the fact that the audiobook that I listened to varies slightly from the original version from 1911, it delivers a great recipe to forget about the system around us. To top it off ["Peter Pan" on Audible](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Peter-Pan-Audiobook/B081HH7XNL) was free a few weeks ago.
