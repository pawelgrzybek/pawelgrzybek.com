I love the "5 things I like right now" series of posts by [Mike Crittenden](https://critter.blog). So, inspired by it, I started sharing some things I like/dislike occasionally. No particular schedule and no limitation about the stuff I write about — I am just having fun sharing some cool shit with you all!

1. Autumn
1. Driving on Friday evening
1. Recruiters sending me job offers (I am usually very thankful for that) without prior reading my CV
1. How unpaid healthcare workers in the UK are
1. How understaffed the healthcare industry is, which is likely closely related to the previous point
