## Top picks

### [A Million Little Secrets](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/whimsical-animations/)

Josh Cameau is about to release a new course, "Whimsical Animation," and [its website](https://whimsy.joshwcomeau.com/) is a stunning piece of art full of little interactive elements and Easter eggs. In this article, he shared an overview of a few techniques he used to build this website. I learned a ton and also explored a big bunch of useful resources for my future pet projects. The attention to detail that this guy puts into his projects is just unbelievable. Who would have thought that image sprites are still a valid technique to build websites in 2025?

### [TypeScript types can run DOOM](https://youtu.be/0mCsluv5FXA)

This is one of the wildest things I have seen in a while. Using nothing but the TypeScript type system, this genius rebuilt a fully functional and interactive DOOM game. The engineering effort put into this project is insane. The scale of the resulting types in comparison to an ordinary web application, Node.js type definitions really helps to convey the effort that went into it. Absolutely impressive!

### [React Libraries for 2025](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-libraries/)

Robin Wieruch published a number of great React-related resources in the past, and this one is just another one to add on the pile. A comprehensive list of React solutions related to state management, styling, data management, authentication, payments, component libraries, and others. Very up to date and all in a single place.

### [Don’t Use Fake Bold or Italic in Social Media](https://adrianroselli.com/2025/03/dont-use-fake-bold-or-italic-in-social-media.html)

Adrian with another great accessibility tip. This one is about abusing some UTF characters and using them in place to fact bold or italic styling, and what the impact for screen reader users is. The consequences can be huge! Rule of thumb, plain good old text always wins.
