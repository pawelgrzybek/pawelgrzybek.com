## [CSS math functions](https://twitter.com/bdc/status/1100921258839953408)

Are you waiting for the next big thing in CSS? There you go.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The CSS Working Group agreed this morning on adding many math functions. We now have:<br><br>• calc()<br>• min()<br>• max()<br>• clamp()<br>• sin()<br>• cos()<br>• tan()<br>• acos()<br>• asin()<br>• atan()<br>• atan2()<br>• hypot()<br>• sqrt()<br>• pow()<br><br>The face of CSS is rapidly changing.</p>&mdash; Benjamin De Cock (@bdc) <a href="https://twitter.com/bdc/status/1100921258839953408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 28, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## [KV Storage, the Web's First Built-in Module](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/03/kv-storage)

Web platform offers few ways of storing data. The most popular is slow and synchronous [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) followed by pain-full to use [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API). The first standard JavaScript library (built-in module) is coming to address this issues — [KV Storage](https://wicg.github.io/kv-storage/). [Import maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps) are here to help to resolve a path to a module. This great article by [Phil Walton](https://twitter.com/philwalton) explains all of these.

## [Sketch raises \$20m in Series A funding from Benchmark](https://blog.sketchapp.com/sketch-raises-20m-in-series-a-funding-from-benchmark-ea298764d7d1)

A big announcement and official confirmation — team collaboration and Sketch in the browser are coming in 2019. I cannot wait for it.

## [Designing An Aspect Ratio Unit For CSS](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/03/aspect-ratio-unit-css/)

Do you remember a CSS padding hack to implement responsive `iframe` / `embed`? The CSS Working Group is working on much more elegant solution for this issue — `aspect-ratio` property. [Rachel Andrew](https://twitter.com/rachelandrew) does a fantastic job by presenting a problem and suggesting a solution. This is part of very early drafts of [CSS Sizing Specification Level 4](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-sizing-4/#ratios) — please, don't event try using it yet. It has not been implemented to any browser yet.

## [Stadia](https://store.google.com/magazine/stadia)

I am super excited about the [concept that Google presented at GDC 2019](https://youtu.be/W7hc4R8JAJY). Streaming service, with no box required, cross platform and cross device. I am looking forward to an official public announcement.

## [New Amazon S3 Storage Class – Glacier Deep Archive](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-s3-storage-class-glacier-deep-archive/)

Amazon Web Services announced new storage class — Glacier Deep Archive. Even more cost effective cold storage service that costs up to 75% less than the previously the cheapest Glacier. It is just an amazing news for all that use this service as a data backup like I do — ["My Amazon S3 photo backup solution"](https://pawelgrzybek.com/my-amazon-s3-photo-backup-solution/).
