## [How I built a modern website in 2021](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-i-built-a-modern-website-in-2021)

He did it and is probably the most hyper lunch for a personal website in The World Wide Web history. But, when [Kent C. Dodds]([Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds)) does something, it is done right. His new website looks stunning, and it is full of the very cool tech behind it. This article is an in-depth guide about building a website in 2021 is a great read.

## [Conditional Border Radius In CSS](https://ishadeed.com/article/conditional-border-radius/)

CSS is excellent, but sometimes it blows my mind. This little trick taken from Facebook's source code is crazy cool! [Ahmad Shadeed](https://twitter.com/shadeed9) tears it apart and shows you how to use it.

## [ARIA in HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/PR-html-aria-20210930/)

This resource created by [Steve Faulkner](https://twitter.com/stevefaulkner), [Scott O'no](https://twitter.com/scottohara) and [Patrick H. Lauke](https://twitter.com/patrick_h_lauke) is golden! That should be an instant bookmark for all Front End Developers. Examples of incorrect use and all possible variations of valid ARIA role states in one place.

## [Announcing Parcel v2!](https://parceljs.org/blog/v2/)

My favourite web bundler just got an update to version 2.0. A bunch of great news is coming, like the new plugin system, tree shaking by default, performance boost, code splitting, image manipulations, better hot module reloading and a lot more.

## [Achieve up to 34% better price/performance with AWS Lambda Functions powered by AWS Graviton2 processor](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/09/better-price-performance-aws-lambda-functions-aws-graviton2-processor/)

I have great news for all AWS Lambda users out there. In some cases, you can get a performance boost and save some money by changing the underlying technology architecture. ["AWS Lambda Functions Powered by AWS Graviton2 Processor – Run Your Functions on Arm and Get Up to 34% Better Price Performance"](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-lambda-functions-powered-by-aws-graviton2-processor-run-your-functions-on-arm-and-get-up-to-34-better-price-performance/) goes more into technical details and suggest a great way to measure the difference.

## [vscode.dev(!)](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/10/20/vscode-dev)

Usually, when people buy a domain to build something cool on top of it, it results in wasted money eventually. The visual Studio Code team is different. They used a domain purchased years ago to port our favourite editor from the Electron app to a fully functional editor in the browser. Insane and so helpful. I tested this one on my iPad Pro a moment ago, and it works well!

## [Can I include a tag to a tag?](https://caninclude.glitch.me)

Check if you can include a tag to a tag, and find out why it is not possible. I love this kind of little helper. This one is convenient for all Frontenders.
