It was the summer of 2007 when I went for a trip to the suburbs of Warsaw (the capital of Poland) to buy my very first Apple computer.  An entrepreneurial bloke who I met on the online forum, brought from the UK dozens of Mid 2007 Macbook Pros, and for a radiculous 5000PLN (≈ $1000), I became a happy owner of one of them. It was the equivalent of my three monthly salaries back then. Cool story, right? But I am just trying to say that for the past 16 years, I have been using multiple generations of Apple keyboards.

A few weeks ago I got frustrated by some connectivity issues with my Apple Magic Keyboard. My usual solution for this kinda problem would be a brand new one from the Apple website, but I decided to take the opportunity and try a  mechanical keyboard. There must be a good reason for the recent hype around spring-activated switches, right?

Without going too deep into the rabbit hole of hot-swappable switches, backlight variations or double-shot PBT keycaps, I decided to pick something from the most frequently recommended brands by Youtube reviewers.
