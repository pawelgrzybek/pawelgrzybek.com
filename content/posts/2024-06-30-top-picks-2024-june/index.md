### [News from WWDC24: WebKit in Safari 18 beta](https://webkit.org/blog/15443/news-from-wwdc24-webkit-in-safari-18-beta/)

The introduction of WebXR puts Safari closer to the presented year ago visionOS, but there is a lot more stuff for web developers. CSS View Transitions (not between the pages yet), Style Queries, animating discrete properties like `display`, better integration with PWAs, improved data and time inputs, fuzzy search code completion (finally). Apple engineers also put some effort into the interoperability of the Web by removing a bunch of properties with the `-webkit` prefix. Solid release.
