Over the last few weeks a few of my friends have asked me for podcast recommendations, so I decided to list my current favourite shows, a little bit like I did in ["My favourite front-end related podcasts"](https://pawelgrzybek.com/my-favourite-front-end-related-podcasts/) back in 2015. I listen to stuff related to the Web platform or Apple ecosystem, literally nothing else. That’s how much of a boring geek I am.
