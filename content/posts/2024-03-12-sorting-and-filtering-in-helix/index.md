I recently posted [a quick tip about sorting in Helix](https://www.reddit.com/r/HelixEditor/comments/1b9j40u/sorting_in_helix/) that quickly became the second most popular subreddit post ever. This is a good indicator of two things: people found it helpful, and it should be a blog post. So here it is!

Helix comes with a built-in `:sort` command mentioned on the website, but its functionality isn't well documented. It works on multiple selections and is as powerful as your multi-selection game. Another way of placing stuff in order is by piping a selection to the `sort` CLI program. Similarly, we can pipe a selection to whatever CLI you want. We can go crazy that way! Let's have a look at a few examples.

## Sort multiple lines (:sort command)

The simplest form of using `:sort` command is sorting multiple lines.

{{< video path="sort-1.mp4" >}}

1. <kbd>%</kbd> - Select everything
1. <kbd>Alt-s</kbd> - Split lines into individual selections
1. <kbd>:sort</kbd> - Sort command

## Sort complex selection (:sort command)

Even though it looks a bit more complicated, the same method can be used on more complex selections as long as they are symmetrical.

{{< video path="sort-2.mp4" >}}

1. <kbd>%</kbd> - Select everything
1. <kbd>s user</kbd> - Create multiple selection
1. <kbd>v jjgl</kbd> - Expand selections
1. <kbd>:sort</kbd> - Sort command

## Sort multiple lines (sort CLI)

The `sort` takes a singular selection compared to the built-in `:sort` command. This produces the same output as the method in the first example.

{{< video path="sort-3.mp4" >}}

1. <kbd>%</kbd> - Select everything
1. <kbd>| sort</kbd> - Pipe selection to `sort` CLI

## Randomize order (sort CLI)

We can randomize content by piping `stdin` (single selection) to `sort -R`.

{{< video path="sort-4.mp4" >}}

1. <kbd>%</kbd> - Select everything
1. <kbd>| sort -R</kbd> - Pipe selection to `sort -R` CLI

## Sort, remove duplicates and count occurrences (uniq and sort CLI)

How about sorting the output in descending order, removing duplicates and adding a count of occurrences? No problem üòâ

{{< video path="sort-5.mp4" >}}

1. <kbd>%</kbd> - Select everything
1. <kbd>| sort | uniq -c | sort -r</kbd> - Pipe selection to `sort | uniq -c | sort -r` CLI to remove duplicates, acc counted and order lines in reverse order
