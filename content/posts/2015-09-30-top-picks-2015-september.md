Internet is full of interesting, useful or funny things. I would like to share with you my top picks from this month.

## Hack Font

It’s new, free, mono-spaced font that works very well with code editors like Sublime Text or Atom. It’s looking so nice, but I’m going to be stick to my favourite ‘Source Code Pro’.

## Poll Results for Managing Styles with JavaScript

[https://css-tricks.com/poll-results-for-managing-styles-with-javascript/](https://css-tricks.com/poll-results-for-managing-styles-with-javascript/)

The results about CSS-Tricks Pool “Managing Styles with JavaScript” are very interesting. Majority of people are not ready to style components with JavaScript instead of CSS. Rest of the open-minded people do not disagree with that idea. I wish to see that pool again in one or two years time!

It’s one of the most starred projects on Github and it doesn’t surprise me at all. This series helped me a lot, hopefully you will find it useful too. Thanks Kyle!
