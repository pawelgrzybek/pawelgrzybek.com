### ["Give footnotes the boot" by Jake Archibald](https://jakearchibald.com/2025/give-footnotes-the-boot/)

Jake Archibald is back with good advice to ditch the footnotes. He explains why using footnotes on the Web is harmful for the user experience and also provides a list of alternative solutions that serve the same purpose without sacrificing user experience. Worth noting that the post is full of little interactions that sometimes are embedded in the long-form body copy. So neat!
