### ["Give footnotes the boot" by Jake Archibald](https://jakearchibald.com/2025/give-footnotes-the-boot/)

Jake Archibald is back with good advice to ditch the footnotes. He explains why using footnotes on the Web is harmful for the user experience and also provides a list of alternative solutions that serve the same purpose without sacrificing user experience. Worth noting that the post is full of little interactions that sometimes are embedded in the long-form body copy. So neat!

### [Content Independence Day: no AI crawl without compensation!](https://blog.cloudflare.com/content-independence-day-no-ai-crawl-without-compensation/)

To celebrate Content Independence Day, Cloudflare dropped this great news in defence of content creators in the age of AI. The modern trends of relying on LLMs to get to the answer as quickly as possible broke a three-decade-old contract between authors and Google. Back then, it was Google scraping your creation and giving you traffic on your website back. These days, AI robots steal whatever they want from your website and give no credit to the creator whatsoever.

Cloudflare changes that and blocks all AI crawlers by default unless AI giants are willing to pay for it. The ["Introducing pay per crawl: enabling content owners to charge AI crawlers for access"](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-pay-per-crawl/) goes more into the implementation details. I love how they used the `402 Payment Required` HTTP Response Status Code to implement [Cloudflare pay per crawl](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/paypercrawl-signup/). Time will tell if this solution is going to work, but to me this is a first step towards the future of fair value exchange between agents and creators. "Happy Content Independence Day!"

### ["Quantity Query Carousel" by Chris Coyier](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/quantity-query-carousel/)

This idea is so neat. Styling child elements based on the count is not a new idea, but to make such big layout changes as presented in this post is crazy and incredible at the same time. This is another neat CSS trick that the CSS `:has()` pseudo-class made trivially easy. As always, a nice easy-to-follow write-up by Chris.
