When is the best time to try something new in your life? It‚Äôs now! But for me it happened to be precisely a month ago, at the beginning of a new year. I accomplished a dry January challenge without a single sip of my favourite Montepulciano d‚ÄôAbruzzo wine. After many years of a pescatarian lifestyle, I decided to go full vegetarian. Arrivederci, seafood! Apart from these little changes, I did one more, much more meaningful thing.

Inspired by my girlfriend and motivated by the ["Digital Minimalism" by Cal Newport](/book-review-digital-minimalism-by-cal-newport/), I decided to quit Facebook and Instagram for an entire month. Literally moment ago I re-visited these two social media platforms for the first time since the end of 2020 to see that I missed absolutely nothing! Fuck all!

I managed to gain a lot, though. The downtime that I use to spend for mindless scrolling social media portals, I replaced with time intensely focused on things that really matter. I had many long conversations with my family, read a few books and learned many new things. I reclaimed the patience to do the time-consuming things that require deep focus.

This month, no one struggled to get in touch with me, and I didn‚Äôt need social media to call my best friend. I didn‚Äôt need social media to send birthday wishes to Sally. I didn‚Äôt need social media to exchange some cool music recommendation with Michal. ‚ÄúI use it to contact my friends‚Äù was just a stupid excuse that I used for years to keep access to this brainwashing machines.

## Bye bye Facebook and Instagram

Before I ditch Facebook and Instagram from my life for good, I will dedicate a little bit of time to fill the gaps in my contact list. In the meantime, I highly encourage you to give life a go without the  social media brainwashers. For now, stay safe, and I will catch you later (not on Facebook or Instagram though) üëä
