Vertical rhythm is a design concept that helps to create a harmonious layout by following consistent spacing between elements, typically using the height of a line as a base. I learned it in my design days when printed media was still a thing[^1]. How much the same concept applies to the Web's fluid nature is debatable, but this post is not about that. To fulfil your curiosity ‚Äî yes, the primitively simple design of my website follows the vertical rhythm.

[^1]: It is just a snarky joke. I love you designers out there ‚ù£Ô∏è

Correctly implementing vertical rhythm is a tedious task. Luckily, the [CSS Values and Units Module Level 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/) defines two helpful units that make the job a breeze: `lh` and `rlh`, which are equal to the computed `line-height` of the element on which it is used and the root element, respectively.

At the time of writing this article, [the browser support](https://caniuse.com/?search=lh%20unit) is limited to Safari and Chromium-based browsers. Have a look at this simple example.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 480px; border: 1px solid rgb(46, 49, 56);" src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/web-platform-psz7ok?embed=1&file=styles.css&hideDevTools=1&view=preview"></iframe>

```css
html {
  font-size: 100%;
  line-height: 1.5;
}

main {
  padding: 1rlh; /* ü´∂ */
}
```

This post is not a tutorial, just a quick appreciation of modern CSS features. Expect more of these because CSS tricks worth writing about are bombarding me daily. Also, it is the first article where I embedded [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com) demo ‚Äî it is a great tool. Have a great day, folks üòô
