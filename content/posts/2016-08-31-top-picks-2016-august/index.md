## David Wells - CSS in React

A great talk by [David Wells](https://twitter.com/DavidWells) on ReactJS San Francisco Bay Area meet-up. All that you need to know about styling React components. Pros and cons of each popular method with strong recommendation of [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) powered by [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/). I don't entirely agree with some parts of David's approach but it is really interesting overview of available strategies.

Tab Atkins explains the reason behind new syntax for CSS rgb color notation. If it's too long too read the only thing you need to remember is `rgba(0, 255, 0, 50%)` notation will be replaced with `rgb(0 255 0 / 50%)`. The reason behind makes super sense.

Next one from CSS Tricks this month. Chris Coyier presents a neat trick to select a whole block on click without heavy JavaScript of Flash based add-ons. Very handy trick especially when we need to make sure that whole bit of code is copied (like a code snippet or telephone number).

## Yes, You Should Learn Vanilla JavaScript Before Fancy JS Frameworks

[https://snipcart.com/blog/learn-vanilla-javascript-before-using-js-frameworks](https://snipcart.com/blog/learn-vanilla-javascript-before-using-js-frameworks)

I can't agree enough with this article. I'm sick of people who call themselves "Angular Developer" or "React Developer". I can't imagine how can you be a good framework developer without knowing core principles of language. I follow teaching style promoted by great Kyle Simpson who is a strong believer in deep understanding before moving forward. Francois-Xavier P. Darveau shares the same school. Great read!

[Glen Maddern](https://twitter.com/glenmaddern) just started a new project called Front End Center. He released just one video so far but this single tutorial was totally enough to convince me to follow and share it. The best explanation of Webpack that you can find. I'm looking forward to following screen casts by Glen.
