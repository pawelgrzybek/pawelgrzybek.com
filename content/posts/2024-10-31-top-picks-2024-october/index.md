## Top picks

### [Announcing VoidZero - Next Generation Toolchain for JavaScript](https://voidzero.dev/posts/announcing-voidzero-inc)

Evan You, the inventor of Vue, Vite and plenty of other well-known frameworks, has just founded VoidZero Inc. The mission of the company is to build an open-source, high-performance, and unified development toolchain for the JavaScript ecosystem. It is a blend of tools from the OXC family, Vite and Rolldown to handle bundling, linting, formatting and TypeScript transformation. Just by looking at some of the benchmarks attached, it outperforms my favourite Biome by a significant percentage.

### [Whatâ€™s the Difference Between HTMLâ€™s Dialog Element and Popovers?](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-htmls-dialog-element-and-popovers/)

Recently added `<dialog>` element and `popover` attribute may cause a lot of confusion. They are so similar in many ways, but there are a few subtle differences between them that can make or break the experience of your website. Chris Coyier put together this fantastic piece that puts it all into one place.

### [Announcing BCD Watch](https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2024/09/23/announcing-bcd-watch/)

Eric Meyer, Brian Kardell and Stephanie Stimac built this fantastic tool that helps track features that are landing in the browsers. Weekly reports with all the features can be a little bit overwhelming, so there is an option only to report on the features that landed in all three dominant players. Also, you can subscribe to it via RSS and get just one update a week and stay up to date. So handy!

## [Announcing Deno 2](https://deno.com/blog/v2.0)

My favourite JavaScript runtime, Deno, just got a big update to version 2.0. It comes packed with a lot of great features, like extended compatibility with the Node.js ecosystem, new CLI commands (`install`, `add` and `remove`), a stable standard library, workspaces (yeah ðŸŽ‰), LTS versions and more. As you would expect from a fancy framework, of course there is a flashy video to celebrate the release.
