### [Announcing VoidZero - Next Generation Toolchain for JavaScript](https://voidzero.dev/posts/announcing-voidzero-inc)

Evan You, the inventor of Vue, Vite and plenty of other well-known frameworks, has just founded VoidZero Inc. The mission of the company is to build an open-source, high-performance, and unified development toolchain for the JavaScript ecosystem. It is a blend of tools from the OXC family, Vite and Rolldown to handle bundling, linting, formatting and TypeScript transformation. Just by looking at some of the benchmarks attached, it outperforms my favourite Biome by a significant percentage.

### [Whatâ€™s the Difference Between HTMLâ€™s Dialog Element and Popovers?](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-htmls-dialog-element-and-popovers/)

Recently added `<dialog>` element and `popover` attribute may cause a lot of confusion. They are so similar in many ways, but there are a few subtle differences between them that can make or break the experience of your website. Chris Coyier put together this fantastic piece that puts it all into one place.

### [Announcing BCD Watch](https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2024/09/23/announcing-bcd-watch/)

Eric Meyer, Brian Kardell and Stephanie Stimac built this fantastic tool that helps track features that are landing in the browsers. Weekly reports with all the features can be a little bit overwhelming, so there is an option only to report on the features that landed in all three dominant players. Also, you can subscribe to it via RSS and get just one update a week and stay up to date. So handy!

### [Announcing Deno 2](https://deno.com/blog/v2.0)

My favourite JavaScript runtime, Deno, just got a big update to version 2.0. It comes packed with a lot of great features, like extended compatibility with the Node.js ecosystem, new CLI commands (`install`, `add` and `remove`), a stable standard library, workspaces (yeah ðŸŽ‰), LTS versions and more. As you would expect from a fancy framework, of course there is a flashy video to celebrate the release.

### [Typography and Opentype Default Stylesheet (TODS)](https://github.com/clagnut/TODS)

Richard Rutter published this helpful repository that lists all recommended CSS typography settings. Most sections are very well described. Even if you donâ€™t need to apply any of these changes now, it is good to skim through because you can learn a thing or two.

### [CSS Tricks That Use Only One Gradient](https://css-tricks.com/css-tricks-that-use-only-one-gradient/)

A very long list of creative use cases for a single CSS gradient. Temani Afif really exhausted the subject in this post.

### [Introducing Express v5: A New Era for Node.js Framework](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html)

This is a moment that many Node.js developers have been waiting for over 10 years. Express v5 has landed, and although it is a cosmetic update, it introduces a bunch of quality improvements like support for promises, dropping older versions of Node.js, changes to the router logic, and a few more.

### [You should go to conferences](https://localghost.dev/blog/you-should-go-to-conferences/)

Sophie Koonin explains why it is worth attending a conference and getting involved in a community. The article concludes with a list of reputable conferences around the UK, Europe, and a few global ones.

### [Unlocking the Power of JSON Patch](https://zuplo.com/blog/2024/10/10/unlocking-the-power-of-json-patch)

JSON Patch is an interesting standardised format that can produce a lot more concise updates to JSON resources. It is efficient, precise, easy to read (not so easy for deeply nested JSON documents), idempotent and standardised. It has an implementation in most programming languages. I found this concept very interesting and I am wondering why it is not more popular. This article is a good primer to the concept.
