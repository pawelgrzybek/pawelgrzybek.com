title: Using the JavaScript console in Visual Studio Code
summary: The JavaScript console in the browser is one of the most popular debugging methods. It would be cool to see its output straight in the code editor, wouldn't it?

Some time ago I published an article about the [JavaScript console in Sublime Text](https://pawelgrzybek.com/javascript-console-in-sublime-text/). It's turned out to be one of the most popular articles on this website. As I recently changed my code editor from [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) to [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) I found a solution to replicate this functionality.

Similar to [Build Systems](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/reference/build_systems.html) in Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code comes with [Tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks) that allows us to pass a file to an external program without manually switching between the code editor and the Terminal. This is essentially all that we need to do — pass a currently active file to a JavaScript interpreter ([Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) in this case - so make sure it is installed on your computer).

## Create JavaScript / Node task in VSCode

A VSCode Task is a set of instructions in a JSON file that resides in our projects file. Unfortunately at this moment it isn't possible to create globally available tasks — they need to be added per project. The good news is that the development of VSCode is rapid so we may see global tasks appear very soon as [I'm not the only one](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1435) who wants this feature. To create a Task hit `cmd + shift + p` on Mac, `ctrl + shift + p` on Windows / Linux or simply `F1` on any platform to show the Command Palette, type "Tasks: Configure Task" then "Create tasks.json file from template" and choose "Others" from the list. Time to configure the task.

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Show in console",
      "type": "shell",
      "osx": {
        "command": "/usr/local/bin/node ${file}"
      },
      "linux": {
        "command": "/usr/bin/node ${file}"
      },
      "windows": {
        "command": "C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.exe ${file}"
      },
      "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

OK, so what is going on here? When we run a task called "Show in console" this will run a shell command that takes our currently opened file as an argument preceded by the path to our node executable. To make things even easier the `group.kind` property lets us run this task via `shift + cmd + b` keyboard shortcut.

In most cases the "node" in `command` property does the job instead of passing a full path. I found this method more reliable though. The path can vary depending on operating system, version and installation method. Update `command` according to the output of `which node`. On Windows the equivalent command is `where node`.

Time for the fun bit! Create an amazing script and enjoy the instant output in your code editor by pressing `shift + cmd + b` or by running the "Show in console" task from the Command Palette. Hopefully this helped you out. Stay curious and build amazing things!
