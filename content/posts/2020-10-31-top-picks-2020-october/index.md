## [Workers Durable Objects Beta: A New Approach to Stateful Serverless](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-workers-durable-objects/)

Revolutionary announcement from CloudFlare for everyone interested in building efficient real-time applications. The key is the persistent state on the edge worker. A fantastic way of building live chats, game servers or some IoT controllers. 

## [How CSS Perspective Works](https://css-tricks.com/how-css-perspective-works/#the-perspective-value)

This article about CSS `perspective` property written by [Amit Sheen](https://twitter.com/amit_sheen) is golden. Perspective has always been one of the most confusing parts of CSS for me. Nice examples that help to embrace the concepts described in a post and clear explanations made this resource a spot in my monthly top picks.

## [Open-source self-hosted comments for a static website](https://lisakov.com/projects/open-source-comments/)

One of the big changes on this website that I am planning shorly is to ditch [Disqus](https://disqus.com) commenting system. It is not too performance-optimized neither privacy oriented. I don't need my readers to be tracked — I want them to have a good place to discuss the subject. There is plenty of open-source alternatives to it, but which one should I choose? This resource was very helpful for me to shape my decision.

## [Julia Mono](https://juliamono.netlify.app)

There is a new monospaced font on the market geeks! It is free, easy to use and available for all major platforms.

## [Say goodbye to resource-caching across sites and domains](https://www.stefanjudis.com/notes/say-goodbye-to-resource-caching-across-sites-and-domains/)

This is the best explanation of cross-site resource caching, its current state and changes that are coming to the browsers soon that are going to make things a bit more complicated.

## [Presenting v7.0.0 of the npm CLI](https://github.blog/2020-10-13-presenting-v7-0-0-of-the-npm-cli/)

A next big release of the most popular node package manager is coming. Version 7 will get support for frequently requested workspaces and full compatibility with yarn CLI. On top of that, it comes with a bunch of other improvements.

## [Slashing layout cost with content-visibility - HTTP 203](https://youtu.be/FFA-v-CIxJQ)

CSS language evolves pretty rapidly and one of the most confusing things recently added to the CSS specification is `content-visibility` property. There is no other resource that helped me to understand its power better than this video by [Surma](https://twitter.com/DasSurma) and [Jake](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake).

## [Node.js v15.0.0 is here!](https://medium.com/@nodejs/node-js-v15-0-0-is-here-deb00750f278)

Node.js version 15 just landed full of new capabilities: `AbortController`, N-API Version 7, npm 7, throwing on unhandled rejections, QUIC, V8 8.6 and more. I am the most excited about the npm in version 7 that comes with this version of the runtime.

## [Next.js 10](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-10)

Announced during the [Next.js Conf](https://nextjs.org/conf/) version 10 of my favourite framework for building scalable web projects comes with a bunch of exciting features. Automatic image optimization using dedicated `<Image />` component, built-in primitives for internationalization, anonymous analytics, rich set of tools for commerce projects and more. There is not a lot of things that excite me more than Next.js nowadays and I am super pumped about this announcement.
