## [Where I'm at on the whole CSS-Tricks thing](https://chriscoyier.net/2024/02/28/where-im-at-on-the-whole-css-tricks-thing/)

Chris dropped the bomb, gave us a back story about the CSS Tricks acquisition, and attempted to get it back. Since Digital Ocean took ownership of this website, it is dead to me. I visited it once to save the Flexbox guide as a PDF in case this website disappears one day - this good old Flexbox guide is legendary to me! It was such a post, a story, and a sad ending.
