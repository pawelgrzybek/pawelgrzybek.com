Since I heard about the CSS `text-wrap: balance`, I can't stop singing, "You need to know the balance, NatWest balance, CSS balance". The origin is the song by [MC Quakez & Shakes "Balance"](https://youtu.be/KPxYYo--mCE), which we always sing with my friends!

Jokes aside because CSS `text-wrap: balance` is really cool. It is defined as part of the [CSS Text Module Level 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-4/#text-wrap), and at the time of writing this article works only in Google Chrome Canary behind the "Experimental Web Platform features" flag. 

{{< baseline feature="text-wrap-balance" >}}

It breaks multiple lines of text to visually better distribute the remaining space and prevents typographic widows. Unfortunately, due to the resource-hungry algorithm, this functionality is limited to text length. The specification draft sets this limit to 10, but the currently shipped Google Chrome Canary implementation limits this feature to 4 lines of text. So soon, we may not need [React Wrap Balancer](https://react-wrap-balancer.vercel.app) anymore. Have a look at the difference!
