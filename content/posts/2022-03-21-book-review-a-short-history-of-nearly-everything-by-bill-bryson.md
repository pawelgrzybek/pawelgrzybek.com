How do we know what we know about such distant subjects like the Big Bang, a distant space or black holes? How much science explored the universe, and what still can be discovered? We know that atoms and particles are tiny, but how small are they really? Luckily Bill Bryson in his book ["A Short History of Nearly Everything"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21.A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything), explains it all very well.

“A Short History of Nearly Everything” by Bill Bryson is a scientific book written by a non-scientific author, making the knowledge it contains easily accessible to the general public. It covers many facts from archaeology, anthropology, mathematics, biology, chemistry and physics. If this sounds like something thats going to put you to sleep, trust me, it wont.

Keep in mind that [the audio version of this book on Audible](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/A-Short-History-of-Nearly-Everything-Audiobook/B004EXKR34) is significantly abridged compared to a paper copy. I enjoyed it a lot and one day, for sure, I will read the original full-blown version.
