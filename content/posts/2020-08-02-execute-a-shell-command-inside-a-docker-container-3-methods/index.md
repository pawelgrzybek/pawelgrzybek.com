Running projects inside containers is a bread and butter task of a developers life. It’s not rare to need to execute a command against a container and Docker gives us multiple options to do so.

2. [Execute a command inside a stopped container](#execute-a-command-inside-a-stopped-container)

## Execute a command inside a new container

Often we want to run a command in an interactive mode inside a new, just instantiated container. Let's create a new `server` container based on the `nginx` image, and run a `bash` command after the container creation.

```
docker container run -it --name server nginx bash
```

## Execute a command inside a stopped container

Same thing but for the stopped container that already exists.

```
docker container start server -at bash
```

## Execute a command inside a running container

What if the container is already running, we don't want to interrupt its internal processes, but we really have to get into it to add a plugin or check some logs? The `exec` command comes handy then.

```
docker container exec -it server bash
```

Quick copy/paste kinda article today. Hopefully, you found it helpful. Ciao!
