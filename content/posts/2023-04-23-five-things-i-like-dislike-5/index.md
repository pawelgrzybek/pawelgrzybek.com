I love the "5 things I like right now" series of posts by [Mike Crittenden](https://critter.blog). So, inspired by it, I started sharing some things I like/dislike occasionally. No particular schedule and no limitation about the stuff I write about — I am just having fun sharing some cool shit with you all!
