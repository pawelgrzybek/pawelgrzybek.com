title: "Apple changed the default shell from bash to zsh, so did I"
summary: "Love it or hate it but since macOS Catalina the default shell language is zsh. I am very excited about this decision so let me share with you my favourite parts of the new command-line interpreter."

Announced at [WWDC 2019 (Worldwide Developers Conference)](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/), [macOS Catalina](https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina-preview/) comes with a lot of changes but in all honesty, I didn't expect [switching the default shell to zsh (Z shell)](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT208050). Since OS X 10.2 Jaguar released in 2002 bash has been the primary operating system shell, so why all the sudden this change? Long story short â€” licensing.

![Bash in version 3.2.57 on macOS Mojave](2019-06-06-1.jpg)

Newer versions of Bash are licensed under the GPLv3 (GNU General Public License version 3) which says you can't use it on a system that blocks 3rd party software installation. That's the reason why macOS stuck with 3.2.57 version released under GPLv2 which dates back to 2007. Licensed under the MIT License [Z shell](http://zsh.sourceforge.net) allows Apple to ship regular updates to this command language and keep a great level of compatibility with Bash.

Because this is the future of my operating system, I spent some time to explore a new shell. Let me share with you how to do it and point out some things that I like the most about the new default shell language.

## Change your default shell

Fresh installation of [macOS Catalina](https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina/) will default to Z shell but an update from the previous version of Apple OS will persist your preference. It is very simple to update this setting though. You have a few options to do so: `chsh` CLI tool, Users & Groups panel of System Preferences or Directory Utility built-in app.

```
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

## Cool things about zsh

While zsh is mostly feature-compatible with bash there are some minor differences between them. On top of that modern Z shell comes with a lot of useful user experience improvements. Let me share a few of my favourite bits.

### Flexibility and open-source resources

Z shell comes with tons of [options](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Options.html#Options) that allow you to make your prompt really yours. If you are not a big fan of crafting config files manually, there is several popular open-source tools that help you manage your Zsh configuration. Bundled with hundreds of helpers, plugins and themes [Oh My ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) is by far the most popular one.

### Supercharged auto-completion

Not only can you skip `cd` to change your current working directory but you can type a path in an extremely lazy way and press then <kbd>tab</kbd>. No need for `cd Sites/projectname/src` anymore because `s/p/s` is more than enough. This feature is enabled by default on Oh My ZSH framework but you can control it manually using [`AUTO_CD`](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Options.html#Description-of-Options-1) option. Look!

This feature is mind-bending. To explore current location just press <kbd>tab</kbd> twice to traverse through inner folders using arrow keys. This feature is part of Oh My ZSH.

### Discover a commands options / flags

There is no need to check the man page of a particular command to find a flag that you want to pass. Just type command name - and press tab to discover all possible options and flags.

### It is the default on macOS

Since macOS Catalina it's the default one, so you don't have to do anything to use it. It is fantastic, isn't it?

## What do you think about zsh?
