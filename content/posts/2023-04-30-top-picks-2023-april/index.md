## [Rust Trademark Policy Comment Form](https://twitter.com/rust_foundation/status/1644132378858729474)

In August last year, the Rust Foundation stated a desire to take action to enforce a set of rules around the trademark policy. In principle, it is a good thing, but the execution was a reason for well-articulated complaints. Please give it a read and submit your feedback. We, as a community, can help protect the trademark and still freely contribute to the Rust ecosystem without fear of violating the rules.

## [The Acronyms of Rendering on the Web](https://www.netlify.com/blog/the-acronyms-of-rendering/)

In modern front-end development, getting lost in many rendering techniques is easy. The fact that people use acronyms when talking about rendering methods doesn’t help. This article by Salma Alam-Naylor is a helpful reference if you are confused between SR, SSR, CSR, SSG, ISR, DPR, ESR and others.

## [Node.js 20 is now available!](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v20-release-announce)

Node v20.0.0 just landed, and it is packed with new features. Inspired by the Deno permission model is an experimental mechanism for resources. It also supports [all new ECMAScript 2023 features](/whats-new-in-ecmascript-2023/), makes a test runner stable, improves the performance of the URL parser and a lot more. Pretty exciting release!

## [It's time to learn oklch color](https://keithjgrant.com/posts/2023/04/its-time-to-learn-oklch-color/)

CSS is getting a lot of new features lately. A significant category of them is related to colours. Keith J. Grant explains why we should start using the latest colour space called `oklch`. Is it going to be the next one to rule them all for the next decade?


## [Dialogs and popovers seem similar. How are they different?](https://hidde.blog/dialog-modal-popover-differences/)

One of the recent episodes Syntax.fm podcast titled “Modals, Popups, Popovers, Lightboxes” triggered my curiosity, and I started to wonder about the differences between these UI components. Not long after, I found this article by Hidde de Vries that goes in-depth about all these concepts and explains how to use them properly. Who would have thought there was as much to learn about dialogues and popovers?
