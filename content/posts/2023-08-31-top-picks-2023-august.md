## [ffmpeg.app](https://ffmpeg.app)

If you have ever worked with the `ffmpeg` CLI, you know how cumbersome it can be with the number of flags and parameters. Thanks to the hard work of [Zeh Fernando](https://portfolio.zehfernando.com), we can now work with `ffmpeg` using a web app. It supports fuzzy search for basic commands and has a nice UI to simplify input/output parameters.

## [A deep dive into CSS color-mix()](https://youtu.be/I9zHX-jSKpA)

I love Kevin's YouTube channel. It is one of the very few CSS-related resources that I follow nowadays. Recent additions to colors in CSS can be overwhelming because there are a lot of them. The `color-mix()` is one of the most powerful features of modern color-related CSS features and one of the most confusing at the same time. Kevin did a fantastic job in this 18-minute video, explaining how it works. I highly recommend watching it and subscribing to his channel.

## [Vercel: Our Official Hosting Partner](https://astro.build/blog/vercel-official-hosting-partner/)

Another big partnership between Vercel and a popular framework. Probably one of the most exciting new frameworks, Astro has quickly gained a lot of traction. It now joins the group of officially supported frameworks by the creators of Next.js. It's a bit concerning that Vercel is gradually becoming a monopoly in the JAMstack space (is JAMstack still a thing?).
