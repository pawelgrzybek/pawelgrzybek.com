## Implement DOM methods: prepend, append, after, before and replaceWith

[https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/c5fb1b6a7e7fc6eccd8355211c43cb6396f86d9a](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/c5fb1b6a7e7fc6eccd8355211c43cb6396f86d9a)

Looks like a jQuery highly influenced a spec creators to implement easier to memorize methods in Document Object Model. I like it so much! Available in Chromium soon.

Everything that you need to know about pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in CSS. [Ricardo Zea](https://twitter.com/ricardozea) did a good work on Smashing Magazine. I didn’t know about few of them. Hopefully you will learn something that you didn’t know about.

## What editor do you use? - FunFunFunction #31

[https://youtu.be/dIjKJjzRX_E](https://youtu.be/dIjKJjzRX_E)

Another episode of FunFunFunction comes with golden advice for myself. I feel guilty of being a tools addict. I like the concept and explanation of work vs. meta work. Worth to watch if you sometimes feel that you spend too much time on tooling instead of product that your client is paying for.

## Side Navigation Bar: Live Code Session - Supercharged

[https://youtu.be/e5CXg1sjTqQ](https://youtu.be/e5CXg1sjTqQ)

Another fantastic live coding session with Paul Levis & Surma. This time theoretically simple side navigation effect until it doesn’t require swipe event to hide it. I really like the approach taken by Googlers to do it.

## Blisk

We had 3 browsers for last decade and nothing really changed apart from usage percentage. 2016 brought a revolution and since begging of a year we got a number of new products on the market. Blisk is another one. This one is a browser focused to make developers life easier by implementing a set of tools unavailable in other products. It's ready to download for Windows computers, Mac and Linux owners need to wait a bit more.

I watched them all pretty much. Google is definitely one of the most influential company in the web. You shouldn’t miss any of these brilliant talks from Google I/O 2016. My main outcome — embrace the platform, learn it and know the web standards.
