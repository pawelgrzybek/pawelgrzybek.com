Both `any` and `unknown` are universal types in TypeScript that allow you to  assign whatever the heck you want to it.

```ts
let exampleAny: any;
let exampleUnknown: unknown;

// I can assign anything to `any` type
exampleAny = {}
exampleAny = 123;

// I can also assign anything to `unknown` type
exampleUnknown = {}
exampleUnknown = 123;
```

So you may be asking… what’s the difference between them? The difference is in accessing those values. Look!

```ts
let exampleAny: any;
let exampleUnknown: unknown;

// You can access Number.prototype method on any
// Without checking if the value is a number
console.log(exampleAny.toFixed());

// You can't access Number.prototype method on unknown
// Without checking if the value is a number
console.log(exampleUnknown.toFixed());
// ‼️ Error: Object is of type 'unknown'
```

Using `any` disables type-checking same as `@ts-ignore` does. The `unknown` is a type-safe counterpart of `any` type — before accessing the value, it requires type assertion or narrowing to a more specific type.

```ts
// Thats fine because before accesing Number.prototype method
// We can be assured that the type of value is a "number"
if (typeof exampleUnknown === "number") {
  console.log(exampleUnknown.toFixed());
}
```

## Rule of thumb for any and unknown type

Use `any` type only during the migration from JavaScript to TypeScript codebase, `unknown` otherwise. Karma will catch you if you assign an `any` type just because you can’t bothered to define meaningful type!
