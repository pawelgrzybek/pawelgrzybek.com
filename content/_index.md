I'm a software developer from Poland living in Northampton, UK. I'm a web standards enthusiast, accessibility advocate, and simplicity guardian. The guy behind the [Northamptonshire Dev Club](https://nn1.dev) meetup. After-hours hip hop head, funky [records collector](/music), and photographer. Welcome to my blog and rest assured that not a single word here is an AI slop.
