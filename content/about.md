description: Hi there, I’m Pawel Grzybek, Front-end Developer from Poland. Nowadays I live in Northampton (UK). When I’m not coding, I’m spinning funky vinyl records.

I am a self-taught front-end developer looking for an opportunity to work with the latest web technologies. Coming from a background in photography, I have progressed through UI/UX design into front-end development with a growing interest in other bleeding edge technologies. Over time I have become strongly involved in the open-source community where I regularly contribute and create projects, frequently attend conferences and follow other liked-minded geeks. This enables me to always stay fresh in finding the best solutions for technical problems. When I’m not learning or working on another blog post, I indulge my passion for jazz and funk music that helps me to maintain a balance between my virtual and real life.

## Some of my open source projects
